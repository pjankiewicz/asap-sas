2230	1	A procedure is soposed to be showing you how to do this experiment. The experiment is missing a lot of things. For example, the first thing sayed in this procedure is determine the mass of four different samples. That should not be the first step in the procedure. It should be to gather the matirials, tell you how to set up the matirials . It should tell you what different liqueds that should be placed into each container and what to labble on the container. It should tell you the size of the container to. It should tell you what temeriture the room should be and how much of the solution should be placed into the container.
2231	1	After reading the groups procedure, these pieces of information they would need to include in order for me to replicate the experiment are ^p 1.In this procedure they need to be specific with which samples their talking about. One needs to see that to the procedure, the samples are, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. ^p 2. The students need to include how many grams of each sample of each substance are needed. ^p 3. The students need to include what type or kind of vinegar they are using. Different types could lead to sources of error which could effect the final outcome of the experiment.
2232	1	The information you would need to know to replicate the experiment are how much vinegar to put into the cups with the samples. Also what size cup to put the vinegar and sample in. Lastly you would need to have a constant place for them to sit for 24 hours so you would need to know the temperatures of the room as well as vinegar. All of these things could potentially affect the experiment.
2233	1	There are at least three things missing from the instracting. First, how much vinegar do you pour into the container? What is the size of the container. And what do we use to measure the mass of the samples? These are three of many problems need corrected.
2234	1	I would need to know were they left the samples for 24 hours. Depending on the climate there, it can affect how it behaves. I would also need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container depending on how much can affect the mass of eachsample. One more thing that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be if any of the sambles were lashed out or removed from the containers when washing each sample with distilled water, that would affect the end mass a lot.
2235	1	In order for me to replicate these experiment, they would need to include the names of the samples in their procedure. They would need to include that, need to find the mass of the samples before I begin the process and very need to include that I would need to find the difference of the  beginning and end masses in grams.
2236	1	To do this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each of the containers. Where would the containers be housed ? our exposure to such can cause a validity error. Also missing off the samples create a validity issue.The samples should be massed again when they come out of the containers. What kind of containers?
2237	1	To replicate the experiment we would have to know how much vinegar in each container. They would need to name each of the material. Explain to put each material into a different containce that was filled with vinegar.

2242	1	The additional information i would need is ;starting mass, counting mass and diffrence in mass.
2243	1	To complete this procedure, they should have given the amount of vinegar and the size of the container. They should have also said what samples to use and what to label them. They could have even added in how to determine the mass.
2244	1	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure must include what four samples we would be testing. Another key part is identifying how much vinegar, is in needed to put in the container, which decides the variable. Other mistakes include the variables need to be identified so that we know what has to affect the other in order for it to be a productive experiment.

2246	1	To replicate this experiment you would need larger amounts of the sample.
2247	1	If you wanted to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar was used, how much vinegar was used and what materials of container was used. You would need to know this in order to keep the experiment constant.
2248	1	The additional information I would need is how big each sample is like in width and height so they are all equal. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, without these facts the experiment could turn out wrong because every sample has to be controlled in in order to receive the correct information.
2249	1	After reading the group procedure the following things would still need to be added the first would be the type of container they say it should be separate but identical but they should list how larg it should be also they should add how much vinegar is needed in each container to keep the experiment constant to the experiment to make sure that they are acurate results.
2250	1	To conduct this experiment properly, they would need to include the types of containers, how much one sample of the substance is, and what the substance that is being tested is. Without this important information the experiment could not be properly redone with accurate results.
2251	1	After reading the group's procedure, I determined that the additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is; the exact measurement of vinegar to put in each of the four single containers, determining the difference in mass between before and after, and labeling the containers. The additional information explained above will all help to replicate the experiment.
2252	1	One piece of information is how large are the containers, second, what is this for and three, why does it need to be separate but identical containers. That doesn't mack much scence.
2253	1	Wood is the answer because wood take wapor
2254	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is the amount of the for sample you are using that takes testing on, the amount of vinegar used and how much is put into each container.

2256	1	The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment would be: ^p 1. How much Vinegar is poured in each of the four containers. ^p 2. which sample had the highest mass difference after the procedure and which had the lowest change. ^p 3.All the samples would have equal the same mass at the beginning of this procedure.
2257	1	According to the group's procedure there is additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, the would need to say the four different samples (marble, limestone, wood and plastic.) Secondly, they did not tell us how much vinegar we need to use. Lastly, how much of each sample are we supposed to use?
2258	1	After reading this group procedure they could have added the type of invited to place in which sample.
2259	1	First of all I would need the problem of the experiment stated so I can staet. I would also need the amount of vinegar stated so all cups can be even. I would also need what type of vinegar was used.
2260	1	In order to replicate the groupt experiment the additional information you need to saw is what the samples were, how much vinegar is used, and how to measure the four different samples, you need to know what the samples were in the experiment because you need to know what to use when your repeating it, so you cant just use anything. You need to know how much vinegar is used, for a repeated experiment. Finally, you need to know how to measure the four different samples to get the right and accurate data.
2261	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is what the samples are, how to find the mass of a sample and how long to rinse each sample for.
2262	1	You need to put an equal amount of vinegar in each sample. You also should test would a little longer to see if it really doesn't loose any mass if an acid sorounds it.
2263	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar I need to pour into each of the containers. In order for this to be reliable, I would have to use the same amount of vinegar. The amount of vinegar could effect the difference in mass of each sample. I would also need to know what I am labeling on each container. I would also need to know how long to rinse each sample.
2264	1	Baced on the students procedure i would need to know what the four samples are, how much mass per sample and the amount of vinegar pourd onto the samples. Other useful information would include temperature and size of rocks for the sample.
2265	1	For this procedure, I would need to know the amount of vinegar. I would also need to know more information of the materials. In the procedure they also should of been specific in how many times you had to repeat it.
2266	1	Record the starting mass and ending mass then sulotract the two masses. to find the difference in mass.The four different samples are marble, limestone wood and plastic. Create a data table with samples starting mass(g), ending mass(g), and difference in mass(g) and record the data in the table.
2267	1	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar they need to pour into each of the containers. One would also need to know the method by which they should calculate the mass of the samples before and after the experimental preassure. Thirdly, one would need to know what the 4 different samples to betested were. These 3 very important items were  not included in the procedure.
2268	1	Where did the rain come from in the first place, how much water is each container?
2269	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need what four things are being sampled, how much vinegar to put in each sample so I don't put too little or too much. Also, I'd need to know how much of each material I will need to put in the four identical containers.
2270	1	In order to replicate the procedure we could need to know how much amount of rain have falled onto the samples and how strong was the acid rain because it seems that the limestone was mostly affected when the other samples was least affected.
2271	1	The procedure that the students come up with can not be easily replicated. There is no list of materials that need to be gathered for this experiment. There are also constructional errors. It would be helpful to have constants in the experiment, or things that are kept the same through all samples, such as how much vinegar to put in the cups. There is also constant, or sample that the others can be compared to, such as a sample placed in water versus vinegar.
2272	1	some additional information that you would need is how much vinegar would you need to put in each container. Another piece of information that you would need is where would you put the samples for the 24 hours. would if a in a refridgerator of on a counter. the last piece of information that you would need is what would be in of the water that you are washin the samples in would the water be hot, warm or cold.
2273	1	The additional information needed is a control variable. They need to state what material was put in first, how they determined the mass, what kind of a container their talking about and was there any thing in those containers.
2274	1	Other additional information that you would need to know to replicate this experiment is what 4 samples to use, how much of each sample and how much vinegar to poor in each cup.
2275	1	The addition information that i would need in the procedure would be what materials i would need to do the experiment. Then i would need to know how much vinegar to put in the four contains. Finally i would need to know. I would need to know the starting mass of each sample.
2276	1	Five pieces of additional information would be to what you would measure the samples with whether it be a scale or something else. ^p2. How much vinegar to put in each of the container. ^p3. whether or not the amount of vinegar is constant in each of the four containers and is where to put the samples the 24 hours it is left experimenting and suetor it be in a fridge (somewhere cold), the sun (somewhere hot) or room temperature.
2277	1	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar goes into the containers. Another thing is how much of each substance would go in the containers, what temperature should the liquid vinegar be ? To what temperature do we let the samples dry ?
2278	1	In the procedure the students should have started by adding which hotrials they were using so that somebody else could actually replicate the experiment when passing the vinegar, no specific change were written, which could change the end results. It would have also been helpful if the students explained what the starting mass of each material was.
2279	1	In order to repeat this experiment, one would need additional information. One thing would be to know how much vinegar to measure out. Another would be to know the size of the 4 additional containers.Lastly,one would need to know how much distilled water to rinse with.
2280	1	The students should have put how they dried the samples and if they put it on something put what it was. Also should have had the amount of vinegar they used.
2281	1	Some additional information that is needed is how much vinegar was added to the container.Another piece of information needed is are the sample materials all the same size you would also need to know what temperature the materials were held at for the 24 hour time period.
2282	1	"One thing the group could have done was concentrated on a specific sample, such as marble, then stated the others as ""samples"". Meaning they could have said for step3. ""Put a marble sample into a container with vinegar and label. Repeat ..."" They also did not specify neither how big the containers were nor how much vinegar to pour in."
2283	1	After reading the groups procedure in order to replicate the experiment you would have to find out which sample goes with which mixture to make the samples replicate with another.
2284	1	The students would need a clear statement of the problem. They would need to explain why they were determining the mass of four samples, they also would need a nepothesis  they should explain what they think their experiment will turnout. Finally, they need a conclusion telling what happened at the end of the experiment.
2285	1	In the information you would. The mass (g) starting with the wood stanger then the plastic that have more. Then difference in massg o.i.
2286	1	In the procedure we would have to know what samples we are testing. Also if each example was ^p starting at the same mass .In the step 2 it just says pour vinegar. We need to know in exact amount to have each container the same that could be a factor that would set off the expieriment.
2287	1	Something else you would need to add to this procedure is how much liquid was put into the containers. Also the things that you need in order to do this procedure.
2288	1	Some extra information that you would need wait be what are the four different samples, how much vinegar do i pour into each containers, how big are the containers and how much distilled water do i use to rinse with.
2289	1	In order to replicate this experiment the group would have to put what kind sample I would be putting in each container because I could put any kind of material in the containers instead of what the group put which would make our data completly different. The group should indicate how to determine the mass of each sample after it sat in the vinegar. Most importantly this group needs to indicate what they used as a control in their experiment because they need to compare acid rain or vinegar to normal the normal erosion of the samples when it is rained on with common everyday water.
2290	1	To replicate this experiment, we would need to know what each samples are and how much of each sample goes into the containers. The procedure also must state that we record our data after each measurement and the procedure should specify how much vinegar goes into each container. The last step of the procedure should tell us to subtract the starting and ending mass to determine the difference in mass.
2291	1	The additional informatIon that I would need is the type of mass, I would also need to know on what  are factor I needed to put the mass, I would also need to know what subject I am going be using. I would need to know how much vinegar I would  need to put in the container.
2292	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be. A control sample shuld hav ben part of the proscger. I retest the exparament take be for results. Would also need to test the pH of the vineger.
2293	1	We need to know what are the four samples. How much of each sample we need, what unit to measure, how much vinegar to pour in each cup, and what word you label the cups.
2294	1	Some additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar used. Another thing that would be needed is a set set starting mass for each sample b/c then everytime you replicate the experiment the same mass of the samples is used & the result can be compared. The group should also clearly state the samples used in the procedure that way the experiment can be replicated.
2295	1	Well, I think that when they move the mass from one containers to another container, there is when everything start changing with the temperature, When we remove it,it gets an a different size.
2296	1	The groups procedure runs acc. Vages and ninnal resu
2297	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know exactly how much vinegr should be purned into the container so that each container can have the same amount of vinigar. I wuld also need to know what type of instrument was used to measure the mass of each rock so I wuld be able to use it to measure the starting weight and then add the same and when measuring the ending weight.
2298	1	In addition to the procedure, there are many more specific steps. This group of students would have to include. Step number 2 talks about pouring vinegar into containers but they did not include how much vinegar to put in each container. So being more specific would make the experiment more valid. In step 4, it says to rinse with distilled, stating how much water would be a better choice, having a content would help the students improve the mass of the other samples.
2299	1	In the procedure they didnt explain it right because they left out, marking the four samples, the didnt lable the containers to let us know pisifically.
2300	1	After reading the procedure I would add to an the procedure (step 1-4) 2 more times so you know that the expirement is valid. Also they can use different kinds of water to see if it does anything to the mass.
2301	1	Additional information that you may need in order to replicate the experiment might be the amount of distilled water needed to add. If you are putting a different amount of distilled water in each container, the results could not be accurate. The difference in masses very from -0.4, -1.3 -0.1. This would be innaccurate without the proper measuring.
2302	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was supplied to each sample because that must stay constant. I would also need to know how to label each container and where to store the samples for 24 hours.
2303	1	1. Check if the samples is difference. ^p 2. check if the sample after 2 more day. ^p 3. Then check all the sample one to one.
2304	1	After reviewing the procedure some additional information that I would include is what do you do after you not it it get for it mass. Also what would you do before you determine the mass of four different samples. Furthermore what mass they trying to test.
2305	1	The group needs to explain how determine the mass of the samples in the first step. Then they need to put how much vinegar into the containers in step number two. Finally, they need to tell what the kind of containers are being used such as size, shape and material.
2306	1	First and foremost, I'd need the materials, if didn't know what it is that I'm working with then how could i do it? Also, the problem I need to know what I'm trying to figure out. One more thing that'd be pretty useful is the hypothesis. Note to take their answer but compare it to mine and see where both our heads are at.
2307	1	You will need a control, you could also figure out witch substance had the most lerst effect by useing a PH meter.
2308	1	In this procedure you would need the names of each sample used, Identify the mass of containers and to record data on a table.
2309	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container. You would also need to know what kind of vinegar was used so you can use the same kind. Lastly, you would need to know what the students are investigating, they didn't include a purpose. All of this would need to be known because with out specific details an experiment can change.
2310	1	To replicate this procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup. Also, they could show up how long they rinsed the samples for. It could change the mass if they did one longer than the other. Finally they could have done a second test to see if there test was correct.
2311	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar is being poured in each of the four containers (step 2), how much is a ''sample'' of the materials being tested / how much of them should be put in each container, (step 3), and how you are going to determine the mass of these dependable variables (steps 1 and 6).
2312	1	I think that wood wouldn't be the best source for acid rain or plastic.
2313	1	They should of included what kind of containers the samples should go in, they should of told you in the directions how they wanted it measured, the making of the table should have also been included. Also, should of included measurements of the samples.
2314	1	You need to add the average weight of the mass before starting the experiment. At first before starting. Write your predict.
2315	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you need to use and also the concentration of vinegar. Finally, you would need to know the temperature at which the experiment should be performed.
2316	1	You would need vinegar, you would need nables to label the containers. And you would also need identical containers.
2317	1	In order to replicate this experiment the procedure must be clarified: or should say how to determine the mass, and it should say what the four samples are also in step 2, it should say how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. In step 3 it should be stated what material should be placed into what container, also how it should be labeled.
2318	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. You would need to know which rock was in which containers and you would need to know which rock is which.
2319	1	Students should add an explanation of why they are doing this experiment.
2320	1	Additional information:the person conducting the experiment would need to include and make sure each sample of marble, limestone, wood and picote is the exect same weight refaxe being put into the vinegar. By having each scraple weigh something diferent, the acicd another vencivve to the experiment making the deria not precise.
2321	1	Need to know what are you using in order to get the mass. What you just counting with fingers. Why do you need the sample to sit not for 24hours. Finally what is all the materials that you'll need.
2322	1	How much vinegar do they have to pour? Where do they put the container? How do they dry it, do they air dry it or do they put it in a machian?
2323	1	To replicate this procedure, you would need the specific type of container. The amount of mass would change between container. You would also need to know the amount of water used to wash fully the vinegar. Last, you would need to know the amount of vinegar put in each cup, for with more vinegar, more rocks could be eroded.
2324	1	How much vinegar do we put in each sample and is there a control variable for this experiment. What kind of place do the samples sit to get the best result. How much distilled wate do we rins each sample with wouldn't that screw up the weight.
2325	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if you should let the samples dry inside the container, in hot air, cold air, inside, outside? Things like that you would need to know to replicate this experiment.
2326	1	"Additional information I will need in order to replicate this experiment, are place the four different samples into fare different containers. Tell what the four different objects are ""obtain a marble,limestone,wood and plastic"". Tell where you place the four different masses  to allow them to dry these steps are needed for me to replicate this experiment throughly."
2327	1	In order to repeat this experiment, i would require the control.Nowhere in this experiment does it state me. Aside from that, i need to know how many ml of vinegar to add me in what size container.All these minor details must also remain constant throughout to maintain validity. These should also be more trials to increase the experiments accuracy and validity.
2328	1	In order to replicate the experiment you need to know what the sample of materials they are using. Also, you would need to weigh each sample at the start of the experiment to find its starting mass, you would also need to tell us to find the difference in mass from the start to the end of each sample.
2329	1	In order to replicate the students experiment, they would also have to describe the amount of vinegar they put in each cup and keep it constant. The students should also record the temp of the vinegar and DH2O they wash the rocks in.Also the students should ofhad more than one trial to make their data more valid.
2330	1	The thing you need in order to replicate is to add more acid rain they allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
2331	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you put into each jar, you will also need to know what problem you are trying to solve. With out knowing the problem you have no ideas what the data is for making it utterlicy useless.
2332	1	For this experiment the group could put averaging the difference of the mass in the procedure, record the starting mass and write that they recorded the end mass. They left all these examples out.
2333	1	The first thing I would need in addition to doing the experiment is first how or with what scale do I measure the samples with. Second what am I testing, must need the names of the samples. Third how much of the vinegar. Do I put into the container. Fourth, how much of the sample do I put into the vinegar. All of those things are needed is additional for doing the experiment.
2334	1	I would put how much of the vinegar you put into the containers. Also how much mass it has.
2335	1	In the procedure it doesn't specify how much vinegar to use, it also didn't specify what type of samples to use. It also doesn't can how much of each sample to use.
2336	1	To replicate the experiment the additional information that you would need would be what you need to know how much vinegar that you have to put in each of the four identical containers. And what kind of samples and how much of each sample.
2337	1	I would need to know the indepent variable, the dependent variable, the controlled variable.
2338	1	After reading this group's procedure, there is some additional information I would need in order to replicate their experiment. First of all, I would need to know exactly how much vinegar was poured into each sample. Also, I would need to know what temperature or condition the samples were stored at while sitting in the vinegar. Lastly, knowing the type of materials would be important in replicating this group's experiment.
2339	1	For completing this experiment you might need to know exactly how vinegar is in the containers. You would also need to know the size of the container and ie the vinegar is to completely be sumerging the samples. The area in the room would also be a goodthing to know about
2340	1	Information that you would need to replicate this experiment is a problem, what the samples are, and labels for each container.
2341	1	Before being able to replicate this expirement, there is additional information you would need to know. One major piece of information that is not included in the procedure is what the four different samples are. They would need to specify marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Other information they would need add to the procedure what to put the substances in because a container isn't specific enough and how to measure the mass.
2342	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few things must be added to this procedure. For example, the procedure should mention the four samples they are using. Also, the procedure should be more specific in telling what kind of container to use. Lastly the procedure asks to measure the mass of the samples, but it should be specific in what units of measurement to use.
2343	1	First you would need to know what the materials were that you were soaking in the vinegar. They are a marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container,. Finally, you would need to know what you were measuring the mass of the objects with.
2344	1	I would need additional information to replicate this experiment by knowing what tempture to leave the containers in for 24 hours. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers to start and how big the sample items are.
2345	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what materials you would have no clue what materials you were using. You would also need to know the preparations to the experiment just in case there were using dangerous objects or substances being used. Lastly to be able to replicate the procedure you would need to how they came up with the mass and difference in mass because there are many ways to get mass.
2346	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know where the containers of substances were kept and if they were exposed to other elements. Also you would need to know where they were left to dry after being removed from the containers. You need to know specities such as if the containers. Do you know which substance you are measuring.
2347	1	I think its batter of with limestone because it will cell it saver than the odere stoffe.
2348	1	The group could have add the name of the sample used in the  experiment to make the first procedure more dear they also could have added a characteristic change to look for in procedure 2 . ^p The first list procedure could have been collect all materials the procedure could have also included measurements.
2349	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you first need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would also need to know what was the samples on, what kind of scale? Lastly, it is necessary to know the light and temperature conditions you are letting the samples sonkin.
2350	1	One additional piece of information necessary to duplicate this experiment is the volume /amount  of vinegar put into each container. Anothe piece of information is the size of the container, to be sure to cover the whole material with vinegar. Also the type of sample would need to be provided to duplicate this experiment, for example what type of wood, maple, oak?
2351	1	The groups procedure could be improved by specifying what the samples are. Until I read the results I did not know that the samples are different types of rocks. ^p The procedure could also be improved by adding the a control, which could be doing the same procedure but replacing the vinegar with water. The procedure should also include the amount of vinegar added to the samples.
2352	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big the sample sizes were, and if you can use any material, not the ones given. The size factors are the most  important because too much or too little  can cause the results to be incorrect.
2353	1	They would have to include the size of the container, size of the samples, how much vinegar, how much distilled water to rinse them off with.
2354	1	I don't know how much vinegar to use? ^p Starting mass has no control? ^p At what temperature do you store the samples?
2355	1	An additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is.
2356	1	One thing that you would need to do, is state how much vinegar to pour into each sample, then they could do the experiment more than once because sometimes just one experiment doesn't get it done. You want more  so if it was invalid once, you will have some valid numbers. Also, make sure the samples are kept at the same temperatures in the same environment so that does not turn into another variable.
2357	1	In order to replicate the experiment more steps needs to be added to the experiment. You would  to clean your supplies,gather brand new samples and repeat the steps 1-6.
2358	1	After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know what type of samples are needed to replicate the experiment. Also, you must know how much vinegar must be added into each cup, since it would be a constant measure. Also, it would be helpful to know the temperature needed, because temperature can change the outcome of the experiment.
2359	1	Additional information that you would need to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured in the containers, the names of the four samples used and where we should let the samples dry.
2360	1	Additional information that you would need is how much vinegar you need. What size containers are you going to use.
2361	1	One thing that would be necessary to know from the procedure is what we are collecting. It tells us to collect four different samples. I don't know what that means. A sample could be of anything. Next, there should be a direction for collecting a certain amount of the samples because if the amounts were different then there would be two independent variables. Lastly,
2362	1	If I were to recreate this experiment, I would not the different types of samples that were going to be tested, secondly I would specify the amount of vinegar that should be added to the sample's containers. Lastly, I would specify what to use for the drying process such as a watch glass, and also what apparatus I would be using to weigh the mass of the samples.
2363	1	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be what materials are to be used. The procedure
2364	1	In this groups procedure, one thing they do not specify is, what four different samples and of what you are measuring. Also, they say seporte, but identical containers. The group should tell us what size and kind of container to use. Another measurment that is going to play a huge role is, how much vinegar and how much of each sample are put in the containers.Those are couple addtics they should add to their procedure.
2365	1	In the procedure of Acid Rain, the procedure doesn't name the samples they are using. It also doesn't say how much the mass is for example, in this case it's (g). It also doesn't show the materials.
2366	1	Additional information that would be necessary to replicate the experiment would be, what the problem is that we're trying to solve. Another important piece of information would be specifically what kinds of samples should be used and the last good and necessary information would be, what the control group would be- a control group is always good for comparing data and results.
2367	1	One piece of information would be to repeat the steps (1-6). Another important information you would use in order to replicate the experiment is to add more data tables. Lastly, you would need to add another different mass to the table.
2368	1	"In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know the types of ""samples"" are being used, because in the procedure there is nothing that tells me. Also, they don't give details such as how to weigh the samples before and after the experiment. One more important thing is that I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each cup, or the validity could be affected."
2369	1	You will need to know how much vinegar you put in each container. You will also need to know what materials you will need, to complete this experiment finally, you need to know what to do with your data after. For example, analyze your graph.
2370	1	To prepare the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cue I wall need to know how the measuring the and mass into vinegar substance.I would need to know how many of each same they uses they concludes the experiment.
2371	1	The additional information that is needed to improve this experiment is you need the ehat the vinager so it is easy to compare to other experiments, you also need to know the hypothesis and independent variable, they do not tell you the strate forward. You need to tell the person that's going to replicate this what you are tru, he to do.
2372	1	In this groups procedure they should have included a control. Also they do not state the amount of vinegar that should be added to each of the containers. Lastly they should set at what mass each sample was at that produced these specific results.
2373	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I need determine the mass of the sample. I have to check the time and remove the sampe i.e from the containers. I have to wait for the sample to dry for 30 minutes. I have to college the differences in mass.
2374	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is what samples I should use. Another would be how much vinegar I should pour into each sample container, and what materials I would need such as to determine mass.
2375	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass they would need the time, that was for the 4 samples, it can be by hour or minutes.
2376	1	The three pieces of additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be the starting mass, ending  mass and its difference in mass.
2377	1	In order for me to be able to repeat this experiment they would have to include how much vinegar to put into each cup. What kind of containers, and what weather conditions to keep the containers in.
2378	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the four different samples are, what to label the containers and after the 24 hours were to you remove the samples from the containers.
2379	1	In the procedure the group needs to add what kind of material samples they are using. They also need to identify how much vinegar they are adding to the containers. Also what will you label the containers once you have the vinegar & materials in it , all that needs to be put in the procedure in order to replicate the experiment.
2380	1	In order to replicate the experiment, this procedure would need some additional information. One piece of information needed is the amount of vinegar that the students poured into the containers. Also, the students should have added what the four different samples were in the procedure. Another piece of information the procedure is missing is to record the masses. With these three additional pieces of information, someone could replicate the experiment.
2381	1	There is not enough information to replicate the experiment. One bit of information I would need is the amount of each sample (in grams) that is required. I would also need the amount of vinegar to add to each sample. (ml). The samples used are also not expressed in the procedure, but they are in the table. The size of the container also matters because that would decide the area affected by vinegar. The type of vinegar  (what percentage) is also needed. Also temperature could have in affect and that is not expressed through the procedure.
2382	1	We would need the repeat information to determine the mass right. We need the marble, plastic and wood.
2383	1	Addition information I would add is the environment its in.
2384	1	In this experiment they could improve a few of the things they didn't include.First of all, they didn't state how much vinegar they added to each of the sumeres.They also don't have a control in other experiment so it would be better if they had a control so that the could compare the results of the different samples to the control, they also could use use more  trials and ole if the results are different or the same as before.
2385	1	You will need the mass of four different samples. You need to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with the other samples.
2386	1	In step 3, three, the instructions need to be clearer; they should tell me to put each sample into its own container. Also, there were no measurements given in order to replicate the experiment, I would need exact measurements of how much of each sample I need to use. Step four should also be split up to make the instructions clear, such as; y let the samples sit for 24 hours ^p 5. Remove samples from the containers ^p 6. Rinse samples with distilled water.
2387	1	Well reading the groups procedure I found that they missed some information,the  information  I would include are, the amount of vnaerge poured into the identical containers, next is the temperature that the containers are in. I would make sure that the temperature is a steady temperature, and I would also say to include the type of vinager because their are many different kinds of vinagar so you would have to make sure its the same type.
2388	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know what the four samples were and you would also need to know how big the samples were when you puit them in also you would need to know how much vinegar to put in to each cup.
2389	1	You would need the amount of vinegar in each container.  The amount of how much the containers weigh. Also how much water you use to clean the marbles. When you started and when you finished the procedure.
2390	1	You would need to weigh the containers before and after, you would possibly need a calculator for finding the difference in mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pot in each container.
2391	1	They needed to be more specific on what to use for samples. It doesn't specify how much vinegar to use and it doesn't say label all four samples containers.
2392	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to aur in the 4 separate but identical containers. I would also need to know what type of containers to use, whether beakers or something cise. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water I would need to use as well as what instrument to use for measuring masses.
2393	1	Additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you put in each container. You would also need to know what samples you would use, because it does not say in the procedure. Finally, you would need to say for how long you would rinse the samples because each one has to be identically done.
2394	1	The additional information that the group should have added is the amount of vinegar being poured into each tube. Also, they should indicate the amount of material they placed in each container. Also, the should have made the labeling more specific.
2395	1	You would need - (1) The same amount of each material because in order to get the same data you need the same amount of everything. ^p(2) You need to figure out the mass of the object when you start and the mass of the object when it ends. ^p(3) The last thing you need to have is to make sure that each sample is done at the same time otherwise it will be inaccurate.
2396	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to determine how much vinegar that needs to be put into the containers with measurements so that nothing gets changed. Also the samples that the kids used all have to have the same starting masses which would lead to the same ending masses. and the children should all use the same type of vinegar and cups so that nothing would change because of how they are in the same testing tools.
2397	1	1 thing that needs to be added is how much vinegar is poured. Without this everyone would get different results. Another thing is there, a top to put on the container? It doesn't say. Also,the last thing that they forget to put is if the container was in room temperature or hot. Without knowing this it could reuin the whole experiment.
2398	1	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment would be what did they use to measure the weight of the samples and what units was it in, what are the materials that you are supposed to pour in with the vinegar. And how much vinegar / sample you are supposed to put into each container.
2399	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional information is required. One would need to know how much vinegevr was poured into each container. Also, it would be necessary to know what type of containers were used. A list of materials would ensure accurate replication of tha's experiment as well as description about how to measure the mass of the materials.
2400	1	Additional information you would need to repeat the experiment would be to identify the amount of vinegar being poured into each cup and have the samples weigh the same amount in the beginning of the experiment. The amount of vinegar is needed so that is eliminated as a variable. The starting mass should be the same so it is easier to compare and contrast one sample to another recording the temperature of the samples or even where they are placed in the room would be helpful so you can determine if the temperature in variable and then you have the clothing to continue.
2401	1	To be able to replicate this experiment, they must include how much vinegar to add. Also, at what temperature the samples should sit and dry, and how to find the mass of each sample.
2402	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know what the four samples are and how much of the four samples. You would also need to know how much vinegar to use. You also need to know how big the container you are using to do this in are.
2403	1	Additional information you would need to replicate the experiment would be how much vinigar you put in the identical cups, because without the amount of vinger stated that results of the experiment wouldn't be accurate nor would you be able to replicate the experiment properly and effectively. Also, you need to state how much samples or how much of it will go into the containers otherwise the results will not be accurate because you absolutely get the correct mass.
2404	1	The procedure needs to says which samples to use for the experiment because it does not say what to put into the containers. Also needs to say how much vinegar to pour in each container. Keep trash of dry effect to the substance during the 24 hours.
2405	1	One thing you would need is.
2406	1	After reading the groups information I realized that in order to replicate the experiment they would need to list what materials they needed. They would also need to make their procedure more clear. Another important step is to list now much viniger needs to de put in the containers.
2407	1	Some additional information that you would need would be that you would need to know how much vinegar you need because if you were slightly off in all of the containers marble changed 4 and limestone change 13 and wood did not change but if all the vinegar was same in all containers the affect could have varied differently.
2408	1	In the procedure, they should state the maximum amount of grams that one would use for this experimint, or be able to have all of them be about the same size. For the first part when it says determine the mass, they should of really said to mass the objects on a scale. If you were to predict, the mass calculations could lead to incorrect data. They also need to state how much vinegar you will be pouring into the containers.
2409	1	This group does not have a list of materials. I would like to know how many people thought this experiment would be accurate or not.
2410	1	additional information fer the student procedure would be the results recorded, the difference between each mass and your predichens.
2411	1	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information that i would need is how much vinegar is in each container and whether to use safety goggles are not. I might also would need an conclusion to see what changes they might have changed.
2412	1	The additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is to know which order to do it in end and graph the experiment..
2413	1	Follow directions do everything cafefully. Connect it right.
2414	1	Ok well wood's was the those mass and plastic had the less mass.
2415	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container are their dropped amount of vinegar going into each container. I would also need to know what was used to measure the samples.
2416	1	We need the groups statement of the problem, we have the procedure and the recorded data. We also need the conclusion.
2417	1	After reading the groups procedure additional information you will need to replicate it will be all the materials, what to measure their weight in, and an exact conclusion.
2418	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to determine the mass of 8 different samples, pour vinegar into 8 separate but identical containers, determine the mass of each sample.
2419	1	To compete the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar was put into each containers. The size of the container would also be important. Other important information would be to have a controled rock.
2420	1	In order to replicate this experiment many things are needed. The student
2421	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to weigh the samples, how huge of samples to start with and to puti each sample in different containers. You also need to know which kind of samples to use.
2422	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would have to be given an exact amount of vinegar to add to the four operate, four identical containers, also in order to make a replicate experiment, we would have to be given the size of the containers used as wel as the demensions of the four different samples. Also, it is important to know at what temperature the intervals were kept at for the 27 hours.
2423	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment is, the amount of vinegar for each container. I would also need to know the starting mass of each substance. I would also need the exact temperature at which the substances should over the 24hrs duration. All variables are needed in order to have a reliable outcome of the experiment.
2424	1	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know what the samples were, how much vinegar to add, and what kind of containers they used in order to replicate the experiment.
2425	1	To be able to repeat this experiment I would have to know what samples to use. How much vinegar has to go in each cup. Also we need to know how to figure out the mass of each sample.
2426	1	1) You would need to know how much of each sample to put in the container ^p 2) You would also need to be told how to determine the mass ^p 3) You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each sample.
2427	1	After reading the group's procedure I have realized in order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the following. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how much of the sample to use. I would also have to know how big the containers are.
2428	1	What type are the containers (glass, plastic)?
2429	1	What kind of containers are how big were they, what were the samples supposed to sit on while they were drying ?
2430	1	In order to replicate this experiment the students would have to include the different types of stone in their procedure, therefore we don't know what their testing. Also, the students should have given a precise amount of vinegar in each sample, otherwise the results may differ. The students should have also done a control experiment to compare their data.
2431	1	Some additional information that you need is to weigh the samples before placing them in vinegar. You would also need to know how much vinegar you need to pair in the container. Also the name of the samples that you are using would be needed.
2432	1	In order to replicet this experiment I would need some more informarion, such as in the directions they should or told ail of the different samples that i was placing in the containers. They should have explained to me bout to determine to mass of the samples. And in the procedure they should have expnaied to me how much vinegar to pour in each container.
2433	1	Plastic-after 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
2434	1	The information the group could have included is to noo the names of the samples, the amount of vineger, amount of sample. They also should have included which data to record on this procedure by making the names of the samples. Their provided information perdon knows what they are experementing on. Also the amout of vinegar should be constant and be recorded along with the amount of samples so when the reader compares the data they will understand the difference in mass. The data use should be recorded periodically when the procedure doesn't explain so you can compare numbers after
2435	1	After reading the groups procedure, I would add 3 more steps. 1 step would be, took organize the materials better. The 2nd step I  would add would be to measure the amount of vinegar that's actually going to go in the cups.
2436	1	After reading the procedure, I would need a lot more information to replicate the experiment. I would need to know what the samples were, what tools were needed and what the objective of the project was.
2437	1	This group may want to include more specific information like how much vinegar they are going to use. In this procedure they say ''pour vinegar'' which is not a specific amount, also this group may want to explain how they are going to label their containers. Lastly, they may want to specify the best way to determain the mass of each sample.
2438	1	I would add a cover to the containers. This is because you never know what might fall into the containers. And if something does fall into the containers, then it may affect the results.
2439	1	After reading the groups procedure it would have been good for the group to explain why they chose the materials used, why marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Couldn't the group have used some other type of material. Also it would have been helpful to know what kind of container and the amount of vinegar.
2440	1	For me to be able to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the places of sample that are going into the vinegar. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar is needed for each aD. Third, I would need to know the size of the containers that the vinegar and the sample  pieces are going to be going into.
2441	1	I would need to know many samples thar are and how much vineger I would need to pore into each sampel.
2442	1	In order to repeat this experiment, i would need to have 4 new samples and other stuff. I would need to keep this date.
2443	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. I would also need to know how big the pieces of each sample would be lastly, I would need to know how much water to use to rinse the samples off with.
2444	1	To replicate this experiment, we would need to know what the group of students used as materials. This procedure doesn't give any measurements of what they are working with, how do we know what size to use? It says to pour vinegar into the containers but doesn't say how much.
2445	1	Additional information that could be added is another trial so the experimentor has something to compare to and to check the validity of the results. Also they should state what the samples are in the procedure. Another would be stating how much vinegar should be put in the cups and how much the rock is submerged in it.
2446	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how to '' determine the mass of the follo samples'' and what measurement to use, the group never tells what or how they took samples, of this is a key piece of information. I would also need to know  what  to  do with the samples after placing them, into containers. The group was very vague when writting their procedure and didn't go into enough detail.
2447	1	I would need to pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. I would remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Then I would allow the samples to sit and driy for 30 minutes to determine the mass of each sample.
2448	1	To replicate
2449	1	The additional information that we would need is really nothing because anything is there.
2450	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar in each sample, what kind of samples, rock, wood etc, and lastly how big each sample has to be. If it has more surface area then maybe more will erode.
2451	1	In order to repeat this experiment, I would need several additional pieces of information. The first thing I would need to know would be exactly how much vinegar I should put into the containers. Secondly, I would need to know exactly how much distilled water to use when rinsing the samples. Finally, I would need to know how much of each sample to use. once I obtain this information, I will be able to replicate the experiment.
2452	1	After reading the groups procedure, I would need further information in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, I would need to know what the sample consists of, of what substance it is. Second, when pouring vinegar into each of the container,how much should be poured? Third, I would need to know what type of container I should be using throughout the experiment (by small test tubes,beakers, glass.) That is what additional information I feel would be needed if I were to replicate this exact experiment.
2453	1	In order to replicate the procedure, there would be more information required: ^p 1 The student should say how much sample to put into a container (procedure no 3). ^p 2 The student should record number, data, observations right after they 24 hours. ^p 3 The student should make said what to label the containers.
2454	1	After reading the group's procedure, some additional information that I saw was needed to repliate this expirement were the four types of samples, what were they. They never stated in record starting mass and it ending mass.
2455	1	To make this experiment better the group of students would need a control so for steps 1 and 2 use water instead of vinegar. Also, there should be more trials to test this experiment atleast three times to make sure their data is accurate.
2456	1	After leading the groups procedure describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. Make sure to include at least three plaes or information sample marble 98 ml and out limestone 10.4 9.1 and -1.3 plaste had 7.2 7.1 and -0.1.
2457	1	In order to replicate the students procedure on acid rain. We need to know to know additional information about this experiment like how much of each sample we would need and also how many drops of vinigar (aka acid rain) to put into each container. Also one other thing the could add in there procedure is samples of what they don't tell you what your samples are untitle you get down to the table.
2458	1	First, you need to find the ending mass and then you need to find the difference in mass. Also you need to state which samples you are talking about.
2459	1	To reppeat this experiment , I would need to know the problem was trying to solve, this why a narrow foew would be kept. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use in step c. It would also be necesary to know what ti use as samples in step 1.
2460	1	One additional information is what samples is the student experimenting on two. How much vinegar is place in each container. These what size container is used. These are 3 additional  information the student did not include to his procedure.
2461	1	In order to replicate the experiment to see how accurate your results are, at the end of procedure number 6, you need to add step number 7 stating that you should repeat step 1 to are or two more times, depending on the experiment. Also, in the chat you can add more information wa average mass and total mass for all of the four types of samples.
2462	1	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I should pour in each of the four identical containers.Does the amount of vinegar vary ? I would also need to know what materials.II should use samples II should know that the materials are marble ,limestone,wood,plastic.Lastly, I would need to know what unit to measure each sample's mass with.The procedure should let me know to measure the mass in grams.
2463	1	I will need to replicate the experiment. Is the three sample is marble,limestone,wood also containers.
2464	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would also need to know how much ml of vinegar to pour into containers. The steps missing include:a step for gathering all needed materials, find the starting mass of each sample and find the difference in mass.
2465	1	To complete this experiment they would need to add more steps. The group's never said how much vinegar to add in the containers
2466	1	"The groups procedure is very vague. For example in step 1 it says to measure the mass of 4 different samples. The word sample does'nt clearly tell you to measure the different racks. The same problem is shown in step 3 the procedure says ""place a sample of one material..."" the problem is that the material could be anything. Another problem in this procedure is that the group did'nt say how much vinegar to put in each cup. You need that as a control."
2467	1	I think the additional information that would needed in order to
2468	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also need to know what kind of balance they used. Finally  I would need to know how long the containers were to know if the samples should be submerged under the vinegar.
2469	1	Detailed explanation of why the experiment is needed. Is aceetion temp desired. How is the mass determinded?
2470	1	To replicate this experiment accurately, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be helpful to know what temperature the vinegar should be when its being placed in the container. You would also need to know what size the sample material is.
2471	1	Onen clear statement of information is with of them drop the most mass. Two did they make sure they check it twice or over again. Three was there data correct? I think so.
2472	1	I think that because marble 9.8 isc good a ncl ending mass (g) 9.4 too.
2473	1	You need to have four different types of mass. To make sure to pour vinegar in for identical contairs for each type of mass, you have to wait 24 hours until you can drain out the mass from the water then you have let it dry for 30 min. After that, you have to determine mass of each sample.
2474	1	You will need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. You will need to know what kind of containers they are talking about. And mostly you will need to know what the group is testing. And it would also be helpful to know what types of plastics, wood, limestone and marble to use.
2475	1	Quite clearly it is first important that the replicate knows what samples are being used. It should also be established that the four separate identical containers are removed during the second weighing in order to get an accurate mass. It is also important to indicate how much vinegar is being poured over the four samples, how it is poured (in drops or with a cup) and what type of vinegar it is. Additionally, the environment where the samples are to sit and dry should be specified. Is it in sunlight or is it in a darkened room?
2476	1	Some additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar to pour, what do you use to determine the mass of the samples, and what type of container should be used (plastic, glass, paper).
2477	1	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar being poured into the containers, to state the names of the different samples in the procedure and the exact size of the single sample. It would also be good to know what container they are using and size of it.
2478	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate would be, after step # 6 (determine the mass of each sample), say that you must find the difference in mass of each sample. Another piece of information that is needed is the purpose of the experiment. For example, are they trying to find which material had the greatest decrease in mass after the vinegar soaking, or the least decrease.
2479	1	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to  know how much vinegar to use, how large the containers are, and how long i should rinse each sample with distilled water. Without this information the results of the experiment can be very different than the results of a replica.
2480	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the four samples were, there is no indication of what the samples were until the data table, but that is not in the procedure. I would also need to know how much vinegar to add into each container, if the amount B constant and also the size of the containers. In addition, I would also need to know where the samples were placed, what location of the room, etc, when they sat for 24 hours. I would also need to know what the constant was to make the experiment more valid.
2481	1	1. You have to tell how much vinegar you will need to put in each container. ^p 2. Didn't tell what kind of material ind to needed to put the container. ^p 3. Do the experiment again to see if the record you got before will be the same.
2482	1	This group's procedure would need additional information if it were to be repeated by another group. The type & amount  or samples to be used, the amount of vinegar to be used on each sample and the location that the samples would be kept in (temperature ranges 0.5 light, etc.) are all things that should be included in the procedure.
2483	1	One piece of information that I would need is the temperature of the expiraments. How much vinegar would also be neccessary? I would also need to know what the containers are made of.
2484	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know what temperature the samples were sitting in, and what temperature the distilled  water was.
2485	1	This groups procedure is valid but allowing it to replicate will be a problem. By adding multiple trials to the procedure, the mass  can be averaged allowing he ability to be replicated for example by taking three samples of each material, then placing in three differently marked containers you can take the average and then have the ability to replicate it properly
2486	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to include in the procedure what materials you are using (specifically not just ''samples''), how much vinegar to put in the containers (just because the containers are equal doesn't mean that the amount of liquid in them has to ke), and what conditions they are drying under(so that they are all the same to decrease the chance of having more variables).
2487	1	Additional information that I would need to copy this experiment is first I need to no how much vinegar needs to go in each container. Second I need to know the four different samples of what. Last, I need to know the four different samples that they have to use in this experiment. These are the things I need to no before I can do this experiment.
2488	1	After reading,the procedure of this groups lab there were certain things missing once are the amount of vinegar in each sample. A net mass for each material, as included of having from deff amount have 4 came. Dosent say every date as make a what. Rolling  about naftly . Dosent say what 4 material one used.
2489	1	To replicat the experiment you would need to know what the samples are, you would need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers, and you would also need to know what kind of temperature to leave the containers in so the experiment works correctly.
2490	1	The additional information I would add to this procedure is; first you have to start out with corrections of what materials you need to collect and how much of each, without this you will have no idea what samples you are measuring. Also the procedure should include a step to get and put on whatever safety materials are necessary such as goggles. The procedure also needs to include how much vinegar you are pouring into the containers, is it kept lab? you have no idea because they haven't told you. There should also be steps to observe and record your data because that is how you  plot a data table. Lastly, they need a step to clean up their work area.
2491	1	Some additional information that I would need to repeat this experiment would be 1) The amount of vinegar that Ii would need to pour into each of the containers, 2) What are the four samples that I am suppose to be testing. 3( After placing the sample into the containers, what should I label the containers as? and 4) After removing the samples from their containers, where should I place them? ^p 0
2492	1	After reading the procedure we would need to know a bit more information. First of all I would have the samples all be about the same mass. Also, the procedure should have stated how much vinegar was put into the cases as well as the size of the container. Since later on we would like to know the average amount of mass that we lost. We should include multiple trials. This student needed a lot of improvement but it was good now he mentioned 24 hours and 30 min.
2493	1	One piece of information you would need in order to duplicate the experiment is an exact amount of vinegar you should use. Also, you would need more information on the sample because w/o the data table. I wouldn't have known what we were experimenting with. Lastly, you would need to know what kind and size of container they used.
2494	1	Three  pieces of information that would need to complete the experiment is one, how much vinegar do you put in the cups? What is an hypothesis? Also how much of each substance are you using? It is impossible to recreate  without at least knowing how much vinegar you are using, i ounce? or i gallon? you can't  redo the experiment without it.
2495	1	In order for me to do project and receive the same results I would have to know samples I'll be using, how much vinegar to use and what type of scale I would use.
2496	1	In order to do this experiment agine you wold have to repeat
2497	1	In order to replicate the lab you would need to know what size the container is. Would need to know how much vinegar , water was in the container.
2498	1	The additional information you need is, the starting mass of the four different samples, the ending mass and the difference in mass to replicate the full experiment.
2499	1	Same additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to pour into the containers with the sample material. Another would be to state what the samples materials are and what they consist of. Finally, the size of the container along with the temperature of the room in which it will be sitting for 24 hours.
2500	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is; where are they gonna put the containers ? What type of containers ? What are the single samples for ? I think that this experiment is gonna be hard to do because they didn't explain the procedure that good.
2501	1	Other information I would need to replicate the experience is how much vinegar puti into each sample. Also I would need to know what samples to use . And the last time i need to know is where do I keep the samples overnight. In sunghlight or no sunlight. At room temperature or not at room temperature.
2502	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is measure how much vinegar in each sample you put in and the the container.
2503	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the samples were that were placed into the vinegar. You would also need to know how much vinegar each experiment was placed into, as well as you would have to know what type of container you would need.
2504	1	In order to replicate this exprerement, you should know the acidic level that the vinegar has. You would need to know the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference between the two.
2505	1	"One line that should be number 2 is to ""grab four separate, but identical containers and label them with the name of the rock sample"". ^p Another:would be after 5 ""using a triple beam balance, record the mass of the samples once again and compare the difference in mass. ^p Another would be in  ""Determine the mass of four different rock samples."
2506	1	After reading the procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be what four samples I should be testing, how much vinegar to put in each container and what kind of container to use. These are important because they would make the results easier to replicate and ensure that I make no errors when reacting the experiment.
2507	1	We would need to know some more things to replicate the experiment. We would need to know what the four different samples are. We would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each and if it is different for different samples. Lastly we would need to know what kind of containers to put them in and if we should label them or not.
2508	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. You would need to know how much of the samples to put in the vinegar, Lastly, you would need to know.
2509	1	You would need double of everything,which means you need to have 2 of everything in order to have replicate of the same thing. You need more of the ingredients so that you can make 2 of each.
2510	1	You would need a hypothesis to start the procedure and a independent variable. Also a dependent variable and then you would just have to know the steps
2511	1	You would need to know the starting mass of each of the items so you can determine the ending mass. You would also have to know exactly how much vinegar needs to be put in each container because if you put too much vinegar or too little vinegar in, the results of the experiment could come out different than the first time because the amount might affect the results. You would also need to know how long to leave the samples in the container of vinegar (24hrs), and how long the samples need to sit and dry (30min).
2512	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need four more different samples, vinegar, and four separate , but identical containers.
2513	1	You would first need to see the mass of the completed experiment. Once you what it is replicate the experiment and see if the mass results come out different.
2514	1	You need hypothesis and write what happens after it sits for 30 minutes.
2515	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers, what kind of containers are being used (shape, size). I would also need to know how much sample of the materials were being added to the vinegar.
2516	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was paired into the containers in the beginning it would also be inportant to measure the mass of the samples after removing the samples from their containers and before rinsing them. For more arcurate results, getting the same mass of each material would supply better data.
2517	1	The students should include how much vinegar to pour into each sample of the four building materials. The types of vinegar should be specified as there are many different varieties of vinegar. The students should include what temperature the water should be as well as the conditions of the room and the type of container.
2518	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar added to each container. If you add only a teaspoon and place a sample in it, your sample want cleane crate as much as a sample drowned in vinegar. Also, what type of wood would be useful because there are many different types. You would also need to know how many trials they did, that way you know if they averaged it.
2519	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the four containers because that could be another factor that you should know if you were repeating the experiment. The temperature has an effect because the four samples are undisturbed for 24 hours. Another piece of information you would want to know is a control group to see how much the mass changed.
2520	1	In order to replicate this experiment you are going to need a supply list, supplies, the procedure and a pen or pencil to record your data. ^p The supply list will be nessary for when you go to buy the supplies and the supplies are needed to do the experiment. The procedure will be essential so you can replicate the experiment. Finally, you would need a pen or pencil to record the data to make a chart.
2521	1	After reading this groups procedure, in order for me to conduct this experiment I would need more information, for example, what are the samples I am finding mass for. Also I would need to know how much vinegar I would need to pour into the containers. As well I would need to know what to label the different containers so I do not get confused or mix up the containers.
2522	1	You will need to have a hypothesis, a statement and and list of what you used for this lab.
2523	1	I would first fix the procedure because it does not give enough information. To determine the mass of the samples we should know the names. It also doesn't clearly state how much vinegar he she pour in. I would also need to know what materials they used, a statement of the problem, and a hypothesis.
2524	1	In this experiment the additional information I would need i for to know why there is a difference in the mass of all and why didn't they all stou the same like wood also to see which one has an better advantage and a picture or drawing
2525	1	In order to replicate this groups experiment, you would need to include where the container was placed for the 24 hours. You would also need to know how big the container that kept the objects in was. They may also want to include how long they rinse the mass for and the temperature at which the masses were kept for the 24 hours. By including this information, you could successfully replicate this groups experiment.
2526	1	If I wanted to do this experiment they should have said in the begging to take out all materials (and list all included in the experiment) Also they should have had a cleaning up pasess towards the end. It would be difficult to do the experiment without all materials said to be and in the beggining. They  also should have put the specific amounts of water that was placed in the beakers.
2527	1	The procedure could be followed but how can we follow it when we don't know what materials to use. The procedure says ''determine the mass of 4 different samples'' But we don't know what type of samples to use. We also don't know how much vinegar to use b/c if we don't know the right amt, it might effect the samples. Lastly we need to know what units we are using to find the mass of the samples.
2528	1	To fully understand the procedure the reader would need to know what the four different samples when they are the follos of the experiment also what kno of vinegar an inloot kind of container eg square cyllindrica etc how long should the reader rinse each sample we should be know what they used to measure the mass to ensure accuracy also what marble limestone wood and plastic is a lot of needed ^p information all of which is measure to carry out an accurate replication of the student experiment.
2529	1	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure given would need to include what are the samples, their stating mass, whether in the beginning, the masses of all samples are equal. Also, the procedure would also have to include how much vinegar is poured in the containers and weather the amount of vinegar is kept constant. Keeping the temperature constant could also increase accuracy as well as performing multiple trials. Also, the amount of distilled water and type of distilled water should also be added in the procedure to replicate this experiment.
2530	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into the 4 samples. Auw when they say container, does it have a lid? or where do I put the containers. Also, they would need to do the experiment with water as a control to help compare the difference.
2531	1	To replicate the groups experiment, i would read to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups. I would also need to know how much of each sample to put in each cup and how large the containers need to be.
2532	1	Determine the mass of four different sample separates, but identical containers.
2533	1	In order to replicate the experiment additional information would include i.e make sure that the amount of vinegar was equal for the four containers and also to be sure that the marble, limestone, wood and plastic are weighed the same while experimenting.
2534	1	The additional information that I would need to replicate this problem is how much vinegar was put into each cup, if all the samples were the same sizes.
2535	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know if you need to cover the samples while they are baking in the vinegar. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Finally, you would need to know to know how long to rinse the samples in distilled water for.
2536	1	In this procedure, you need more specific information to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar is poured into each sample because without knowing that, you wouldn't be able to replicate the experiment. You would also have to know what kind of concentration the vinegar has because each vinegar is different which could change your results.You would also need to have all the different  samples be the same size because without knowing the size of the materials, you wouldn't get the same results.
2537	1	First off, they should tell us what the four different samples are. They should tell us how much vinegar to pour in all of the containers. They should tell us what to label each separate container and to put which sample in which container. Lastly, what you measure the mass of the samples with.
2538	1	You would need to put times down after each material so they were all opened at the same time also you would have to lable each material so you would not get each of them mixed up.
2539	1	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few additional pieces of information needed. The first is the amount of vinegar needed in each container, you also need to know how much of each sample is necessary. It should also be clear whether or not it is necessary  to have the same amount of each sample knowing wether they  need to be the same masses or size is crucial.
2540	1	In order to replicate the groups experiment, they would need to specify what the four different samples were that were being put into the vinegar. They would also need to tell me about what size piece of cash sample I should use so that they would all be the same. I would also need to know how many ml I should use of the vinegar.
2541	1	The must int how much vinigar they used. They should tell us how big the container shuld be. They should tell you what to label so you don foget langs mixed up.
2542	1	The group's procedure is missing a couple of steps. First off what samples? what are samples. Can this be con that need to specify what materials will be used as samples. Second they do not tell us to determine the difference between the starting and the ending mass of the objects. And lastly how much vinegar and how much sample should we use. All it says is to pour vinegar into four cups, it needs to specify how much vinegar should be poured.
2543	1	A great idea for additional information could be the amount of vinegar that you poured into each samples. The total of mass between the four samples would have helped to. It would've gave the reader a better understanding.
2544	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the samples,  I would also need to know what the 4 samples are, I would also need to know how to rinse the samples.
2545	1	The additional information I would in order to do this experiment is, how much vinegar I need to pour into each cup so I can be as precise as possible, what type of vinegar they used so the experiment can be the same, and what type of containers they used so I can be sure that the experiment is done thesame.
2546	1	Some addition information you would need to produce. This experement is the knowlege of at what tempature envirnment the single ( each sample here consists) , how much distilled water you must add to the samples and how much vinegar to add to the sample material.
2547	1	To complete the expirament you must know 3 more things to replicate the expirament. First of all, you must know how much vinegar is put in each container. You must also know the mass of the container and the amount that each is washed with a distilled container. Knowing that information will make doing this lab easy.
2548	1	To replicate this experiment, i would advice and use the sample with the most difference in mass to help get mg answer in which one was the best uses.
2549	1	One thing that  the group needs to add to the procedure in order to replicate it is how much vinegar they put in it. They also need a control because without a control the test is not cred out. They also need to list the size of the container, they also need to tell us the temperature they kept to at.
2550	1	For me to repeat this procedure, I would need to know how much vinegar do I pour into the four separate containers.I would also need to know how much of each sample I use because it doesn't tell me, it just gives the name of the samples.
2551	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the pH of the vinegar. I also would need to know what type of plastic and the species of wood that they used in their experiment.
2552	1	There are some things they left out in the procedure, one thing was how much vinager to put into the containers, how much of the sample material to put in each container.
2553	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each individual container. You would also need to know if it would be necessary to run a repeat trial, as well as where you would store the containers ( in a hot place, cold place, seperate, altogether, etc).
2554	1	The student should be more spanific and state the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each container also the student should state how big each container should be another thing the student should state is how long the rocks should be rinsed with distilled water.
2555	1	The additional information I would need is how much Vinegar and a more specific explanation of the container then just 'identical'. It would also be helpful if the told us what the different samples were.
2556	1	If you are to planning on doing this experiment, you must find out the mass before anything is done than right after. Who ever performed this experiment did not weigh the stones out before they were rinsed off. This is critical because you do read this information.
2557	1	Some information that I would need would be how much vinegar is put into the containers, I would also need to know if the vinegar was cooled or heated or room temp, were their seprate trials and is this here a table of average masses? How acidic was the vinegar, will mass of the material affect how fast the vinegar corrodes it ?
2558	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container.Also would need to know what the samples are that you you are experimenting with.Then you would need to know the date as you started with the mass, because it never said to record the data.
2559	1	In order to replicate this experiment completely, you would need to know what the mass was before putting the items in the vinegar, you would also need to know how much vinegar is needed in the beakers.
2560	1	1.Dealing with this lab experiment, additional information that I would give would be the name of the material used in each container. 2.I would explain more of why certain items and or objects was used for example vinegar. Besides pouring vinegar in each cup what part did it play in this experiment, question like what was vinegar soppose to do. e.t.c...
2561	1	The group doing the experiment didn't state the amt of vinegar they poured into each rock. Therefore, there data isn't accurate. This group also did not state a control variable. The reason for the experiment is to compare the results to another rock. They also did not state what kind of water to wash it with. We wouldn't know if the water would affect the rock.
2562	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need some additional information. In step one, i need to know what the 4 samples are and how to determine the mass. In step two, i must know how much vinegar to pour into each containers. In step three, if never danfies that the rock samples are in three same containers as the vinegar.
2563	1	How big the containers should be because the vinegar might absorb more in a more condensed enviorment. It is also necessary to know how much vinegar is needed in each of the four containers. You would also need to know how big each of the samples should be because the vinegar might absorb more if it is small.
2564	1	In this experiment they need to say what the are puting into the liquids. They also need to say what temp to leave it at. Also what they are trying to find out.
2565	1	To replicate this expirement you need to know. ^p      - How as the containers should be. ^p      - What samples - materials do you have the experiment based on. ^p      - Remoslity of the ending mass. ^p      - Mass beam balance.
2566	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples. You would also need to know how much of the vinegar and other samples to put in the container. The size of the container is also necessary information in order to accuratly replicate the experiment. In the procedure, you must also list the four different types of samples that you are going to use in the experiment
2567	1	In order to replicate this experiment,i would need a problem statement.I don't know what they are trying to figure out.Without this knowledge if i do the experiment,the data collected will be useless since I wont know how to use it.Another piece of information I would need to replicate this experiment is the amount of sample and amount of vinegar.I don't know how much vinegar to put into each cup.Also I must set starting weight for the samples.If they are not equal to start out the experiment would have been changed.The last thing I would add is a materials list.This would make it much easier to see what materials I would need for this experiment without it I would have to look for them and place them out of the procedure.
2568	1	You need to be sure that they let it sit for 30 minutes and make sure they left it sit in the vinegar for 24 hours. Plus you need they put the same amount of vinigar in all 4 materials.
2569	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the starting  mass of each sample to be the same weight as the sample in the students' data. You would also need to know the ph scale of the distilled water to see if it's an acid or a base. The third piece of additional information would be to contrast or compare it to other forms of acid rain.
2570	1	Step one asks to determine the mass of the four samples. They should add what to use to weigh it and list the four samples.In step two they should tell us the amount of vinegar to pour. Step three, they should've made the sentence; repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container. It's own step.
2571	1	To replicate the students experiment , I would need to know what there control was, I also would need the dependent and the independent variables. I would need to know the types of cups they used. I also need to know how much vinegar was poured into the cups.
2572	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what samples I was using, the starting mass, ending mass and the difference in  mass.
2573	1	Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be: what are you sampling, how much vinegar to pour and how much of the sample should I put in the container.
2574	1	In order replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar was put in the containers at what temperature the experiment was done at and what type of vinegar to use you would need to know this information increase the lab in a controlled manner that these things were not specified in the procedure.
2575	1	"Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be to know a what kind of vinegar that the people used because there are more varieties and brands and to the containers should be identical. How am I supposed to know what type of container they used? Did they use a graduated cylinder? a petri dish? Also, in step number four of the procedure (where it says & 1 cycle ""After 24 hrs, remove the samples from the container & rinse with distilled water"") it should say what temperature of the water and for how long."
2576	1	In order to replicate the experiment one of the things i would need to know is what you are going to use to measure the mass, secondly, i would need to know after the samples are removed from the containers, where they are going to be placed, in a separate  container?. Finally, another piece of information i would need to know is the formular to find the mass
2577	1	3 additional pieces information you would need to replicate the experimentare stating how you would determine the mass of each sample. State where the samples would sit and dry. And finally, state how much vinegar you would use. All of these things will increase the validity of the experiment.
2578	1	In order to properly replicate the experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each container. Also, i would need to know what kind of tool was used to put the samples in and what kind of tool was used to take the samples out. In addition, i would need to know what kind of materials were in the four containers, also they didn't specify how they determined the masses of each sample. I would need to know what kind of tool they used.
2579	1	One additional piece of information needed is how much vinegar is needed to pour in each of the container s. There is no amount specified and that information is needed another piece of information needed is how  much distilled water is used to rinse each sample that amount needs to be stated last information determining how to pour the sample is needed because that method not to be controlled so as not to create water variable.
2580	1	I would need to know the determined mass of each sample. So i could complete the investigation of the and drid fnin project. I'll need to pour vinegar in each of four seperate containers. Then place a sample of each material into one container. Then after 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
2581	1	After reading them group's procedure, I would add some additional informations to it. First the group should use water as a control to compare with the result of vinegar. Second, the amount of vinegar added for each sample should be identified and held constantly for each sample. Finally, the group should also identify the concentration of the vinegar solution. The amount of vinegar and concentration of the vinegar both affect the accuracy of the data
2582	1	You need to know how much vinegar to use.You also need to know what type of vinegar to use because there are many different types. You also need to know the control because we need to know what this is being compared to.
2583	1	The additional information you need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar being poured into the identical containers, the amount of each sample needed, how much you would remove each sample from the containers, the amount of distilled water needed, and where would you place the samples to dry. The procedure should be more specific into their steps.
2584	1	After reading group procedure the additional information I would need to complete the experiment is the the moon of vinigar poured in to each cup, Also to indoed what each sample i need is in case set not having the data table below and finaly what type of containr should the sample be placed into to avoid a chemical reaction.
2585	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar used without the exact ^p In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar used without the exact amount of vinegar, even with the masses of the samples, there is no way to know if you are doing the correct experiment. The amount of vinegar determines how much the mass of the sample would change. So without the amount of vinegar, there is no way to replicate the experiment exactly.
2586	1	In order to replicate this expirement, I would need to know how much vinegar is used on each sample. Also more than one trial of the experiment should be performed, in order to get more accurate results. Another thing needed would be one of each sample without vinegar to act as a control for the experiment.
2587	1	After reading the steps procedure, i still need to know, to find the difference  in mass, make a graph and to record my data  inorder to reproduce their experiment.
2588	1	You would need more samples of material vinegar and conduct the experiment.
2589	1	After reading the groups procedure, I believe that I would need some additional information in order to replicate the experiment for instance, the procedure doesn't mention the four samples being used in the experiment they are only pint mentioned in the students' data table. Also, the procedure doesn't tell you how much vinegar needs to be added in the four identical containers. The procedure doesn't mention how much of each sample needs to be placed in the containers. And lastly, the procedure doesn't tell me what I should measure the mass of the samples with and how I am supposed to get the differences in mass of the four samples in the experiment.
2590	1	In order to repeat this procedure acuratly,  I would  need to know how they mesured the samples(Ibs,grams), I  would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how each cup should be labled.
2591	1	In the problem it say was could by add and I say safety experiment and a measurement to way the mass.
2592	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar I should pour into each container. Also, it should tell us in the procedure that it is required to find the starting mass of the samples. Last,where should I put the samples when I remove then from the containers.
2593	1	In order to replicate this experiment from the procedures there is 3 more pieces of information I need to know. 1, what are the 4 samples I am putting in the container. 2, how much vineger am I using. 3, how much of the sample am I putting in the vineger, does the size and surface area have to be the same.
2594	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is how much of vinegar to pour in the separate containers. Also, at what temperature should the samples sit at. I need to know if it was warm or cold during the 24 hours to see if it affects the hardening process of samples. Lastly, how hot or cold does the water have to be to rinse off the sample.
2595	1	The three things you need in the procedure are in , I you need to know what to weigh it in grams, oures, pounds. The second missing piece of information is how much vinegar to pour in each identical container. The last piece of information missing when you rinse the substance how long to rinse them for.
2596	1	This experiment lacks some key information. First of all, at no point does it specify the strength at the vinegar which could have an effect on how much degrades. Correspondingly, the surface area of each object is certainly related to its degradation. The smaller the surface area in relation to its mass the less relative degradation. Also the environmental factors certainly play a rate to the temperately.
2597	1	The first thing I would add in  the procedure is what kind of containers. Then a control for the experiment, the finally I would add more trials.
2598	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and how big the samples should be in size. Also, you would need to know what kind of wood or plastic you are testing.
2599	1	The additional information I would put in the procedure, is the amount of vinegar you put in the container. ^p There also should be a container with no material in it just as a refrence for the graph. Am also, when they put it into a single container they didn't specify if they were sitting in the containers in the time they were  placed for 30 minuins.
2600	1	If given only the information in the procedure, I would still need to know what material the four samples should be, if the kind of vinegar matters and any additional necessary materials to do the experiment.
2601	1	To replicate this experiment much more information would be needed. The first thing they would need to add is the type of rats and their starting mass which needs to be held constant.The 2rd thing is the amount of vinegar used and the 3rd is the size of the cup.All this information is vital in re-crating this experiment.
2602	1	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need to know what kind of container to use. If the containers should be sealed, what temperature should the samples remain at during the 24 hour period and for the procedure to be more specific in general.
2603	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to add more sample to experiment with, you would also need additional containers to place the sample in and you would need more vinegar to pour in the containers. If you were to replicate this experiment the materials needed would have to be added to determine the mass of the samples. For replicating the experiment you may also add different materials to determine the differences of the masses.
2604	1	The information that is needed to complete the experiment is to tell what kind of rock samples are they using. Also, there needs to be a constant amount of vinegar in each container. They didn't say hau much vinegar to use. After 24 hours, there was no specification on how long to rinse the samples.
2605	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need vinegar into four separate, but identical containers.  You would  place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples after 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Let it sit and dry for 30 minutes. For additional information we would need to know why the group of students would come to find the mass of the different samples.
2606	1	I would include the amount of vinegar put into each container, because that could have an effect on the overall outcome. I would also include the names  of the samples, because how would you know what to place minto the container. After that I would say how much of each sample I would put in the container, because the amounts could cnahge the outcome.
2607	1	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in each container, what the size of each sample would be and how many trials should be performed for each materials.
2608	1	To complete ana replicate the student's experimental procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in container. If I do not, there will be different amounts which will change the result. I would also need to know how long to rinse each sample for in how much distilled water. Finally i would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample.
2609	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to poor into each container. Also how long to rinse it. Also how big the samples would need to be.
2610	1	In order to replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the sample are how much vinegar to pour in the containers, and what kind of container to put the samples in.
2611	1	In order to be able to replicate this lab, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar. I would also need to know what temperature the distilled water should be as well as how many trials they did mullely trials gives more accurate answers.
2612	1	I would need to know what four different samples to use in step 1. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup in step 2 and also, how much of the materials to put in the containers in step 3.
2613	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what kind of samples you will be using. You need to know to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You also need to know how much vinegar to pour in, so that all the samples have the same exposure and the experiment is not tainted or flowed. The students could also state what kind of containers to use- a graduated cylinder, a beaker or something else. Saying you need a container is very vague.
2614	1	In order for me to complete this experiment, I will need to know what the samples are. I am going to need to know what we are equit with. I will also need to have a controlled variable.
2615	1	Marble-9.8 ^p Limestone-10.4 ^p Wood-11.2 ^p Plastic-7.2
2616	1	In order to replicate this experiment you need to have a controlled variable, you need to know how much vineagar to pour into the cups. You also need to know how much water you use to rinse with.
2617	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know what each of the four materials were in the procedure. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how long the material should be rinsed for after 24 hours.
2618	1	Any additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment of acid rain would be the reliability of what this procedure would of been affected on by the independent variable. I know that the independent variable is the samples & the dependent variable is the mass change, so how was the temperature during this experiment?
2619	1	1. How would I determine the mass of each sample. ^p 2.
2620	1	Get the mass of four different samples and pour the vinegar in each. After 24 hours, you remove samples and rinse with water. Let dry for 30 minutes and then determine mass again.
2621	1	To replicate this experiment you would need  some additional information. First, you would need to know the amount  of vinegar in the cup. You must also know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water. Another faster you must know is the Ph level of the vinegar,
2622	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. If I don't know the amount of vinegar then I won't keep the experiment constant with any results. I would also need to to know the whole procedure including the safety tips.
2623	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the additional information need would be to give specific alments of vinegar to put in each container.
2624	1	To replicate the experiment the group should include measurements for how much vinegar should be used. This will give the person replicating the experiment a greater understanding of what to use.
2625	1	In order to replicate this experiment, i  will first need all of the lab materials used, i will also need a balance to record the show mass and finding mass. Finally, i will  need a calculator to find the difference of the mass. This experiment was the observation, and math that i think with their three pieces,i would replicate to the experiment.
2626	1	I would need to know what samples to use. How should I measure the samples ?
2627	1	In order to replicate the missing data, then the students would need to tell us how much vinegar they used in the cups. Also they need to tel us how much water they used. And lastly they need to tell us what environment to let the samples dry in. This is what I need to be able to repeate the experiment.
2628	1	First they need to say what materials they need to do the experiment (limestone, marble.......). Also the procedure needs to be clearer and they need to explain the removing process a little more. Also they do not tell you how much vinegar you need to pour in.
2629	1	Other information would be what measurements in the cups how much distilled water do you rinse with and how to determine the samples.
2630	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, there would be several pieces of information ^p you would need to know. First, you would need to know which device you would need to use to measure the mass of the samples, and which samples you would need to use. Also, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed to be poured into the containers. Finally, you would also need to know how much distilled water you should use to rinse each sample, for how long you should rinse it for, and at what temperature the water should be at.
2631	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know a conclusion how long it took for the sample to dry and how you get the for different samples.
2632	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of vinegar they usu, what temperature the samples were stored at, and what size the contained was.
2633	1	First thing you would do is the control of the procedure. The next thing you would need to know is all of the different samples.
2634	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed in each of the containers . Also you would need to know how much distilled water to use. The procedure also does not say whether or not the samples such as marble, limestone, wood and plastic should all be the same mass.
2635	1	To make a ceplica of this experiment, I would need to know which kind of samples are needed, and then how much of each sample is needed to be placed in each container. Then, I would also need to know how much vinigar would be needed to pour into each container, when removing the samples to sit and dry, while is this supposed to hopping on a table, under a light etc. That information would need to be included for this experiment to be ceapeted.
2636	1	The additional information that you'll need in order to replicate the experiment is that you'll need the procedure in order to figure out th' starting mass, ending mass and the difference in mass. For each sample, their starting, ending and difference in mass are all different.
2637	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scale to measure the four different samples, a given amount of vinegar to pour in each container, labels for each container, and an amount of time to rinse each sample with the distilled water.
2638	1	Additional information needed would be the exact amount of vinegar whose the samples are placed to dry and how long to rinse each sample.
2639	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this lab would be: ^p . The ammount of vinegar used. ^p . The vestle used to hold the samples because it might burn a normal cup. ^p . How to dry them because they might have used a different method than I might imploy. ^p . Materials list to know how mutch of everything (rocks, vinegar).
2640	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to use, also you would need to know the what types of materials to use in the experiment and you would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples.
2641	1	One peice of additional information one would need to know is how are you supposed to determine the mass. There are many different ways to determine this. Another peice of information unknown to the coder is how much vinegar one is supposed to use in the experiment. Finally, you would need to know what size the samples need to be.
2642	1	The students procedure was very vague. The first thing they should it done was in list all the materials that were required for the experiment. Also, they say to determine the mass of each sample but they must include how to get the mass so it is accurate and time the experiment is performed. The procedure is also very vague when it talks about during a sample of one material into a container. I do not know list that material 's.
2643	1	Starting in number 2, they didn't tell me how much vinegar to pour into a container, they didn't tell me what type of container either. They also didn't tell me what unit of measure to weigh the rocks either.
2644	1	in order to replicate this experiment, I would need specific amounts, measurements and labels of the material involved. I would need to know the specific amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would need one material which would result as my control and I would probably need to know what the mass of each identified material was before I rinsed it with distilled water.
2645	1	The additional information needed is the name of each of the four samples, how you should weigh the samples and how much vinegar should be put into the containers.
2646	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate, the experiment is how much vinegar is to be poured into the containers, what thing of samples are needed how to label the containers that the samples and vinegar in it and what kinds of things are needed for the control.
2647	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container. They also never tell you what you need samples of to use during the experiment. Lastley, it is never mentioned to record your data or what materials are used throught the experiment.
2648	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar is needed. I would also need to know what to use to weigh the mass of each item.
2649	1	The additional information that I would need in order to complete this experiment would be how much vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also you would need to give the direction to determine what using the four different samples were for each of the cups. Lastly you would need to acurately determine which was the controlin the experiment and to tell the difference in two masses.
2650	1	In this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to add. If you place it in sun or shade and. and where you need the containers as.
2651	1	The group forgot to include how much vinegar to pour into the cups. They also did not say what to lable the cups after you are finished.
2652	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know why you need to know the mass of four different samples. What are you trying to do with that information. Also you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples, you also need to know if the water you need to rinse the samples with should be cold or hot.
2653	1	They did not give you a  ny information signs, in what temperature we should keep the it in, they also didn't tell you how much vinegar to pour in. Another key information  they didn't give us is what is the sample.
2654	1	You would need the amount of vinegar poured into the container to make sure it was equal. You'd also need a supplies list , so you know a need of time what you need. Another thing you'd need to know was where to keep the samples (ie, room temperature, in the dark etc)
2655	1	The additional information I would add, would be the amount of vinegar needed. How big of a piece of sample to use and how big of a clip that is needed.
2656	1	"In the third step of the procedure it does not clarify what material you are putting into the containers also, it does not explain what you are supposed to label the containers and why. It just says ""label"" it also doesn't say what type of containers to use, and how much vinegar should be poured."
2657	1	How to determine the mass.
2658	1	After reading the procedure, I would need three additional pieces of information to replicate this experiment. I would need to know the amount of vinegar added to each container, what kind of container to use and the type of samples to use.
2659	1	The procedure would need to identify the samples and how much vinegar hase.
2660	1	Three additional pieces of information you would need in order to replicate this experiment are whet to weigh the mass has how much vinegar to put in the cup and how big the a sample is.
2661	1	This additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar you pour into each container another additional information you would need is the same measuring scale that you weigh each sample an you also should know what kin d of container to use and about how much of each sample to test.
2662	1	The information I would add to this procedure is what the samples are. Although the data table shows them. If we didn't hav the table we wouldn't know what we're testing. I would add abrble,Limestone wood and plastic  instead of just repeating samples.
2663	1	In order to replicate this experiment the students should: 1. Specify the amount of vinegar to be added to the sample. 2. Each sample should have the same starting mass and 3. Specify what kind of conditions to let them sit the 24 hours in.
2664	1	They didn't include how much vinegar they poured in each sample cup. How would they measure the mass ?
2665	1	For this experiment the students should state what kind of materials in the procedure before collecting the data and putting of on a table. Also get more of the same materials so you can test them on different times. And also the students should lengthen their time on the experiment.
2666	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the size of the samples. The surface area varies depending on the size. In order to replicate this experiment, I need to have the same surface area. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured over the rocks. If the then the replicated experiment would not be the same. I would also need to know about the environment the containers are kept at, such as the temperature and whether or not light is exposed to the containers.
2667	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this procedure is what the 4 samples are, what to use to weigh each sample, and what to label the samples as on the container.
2668	1	You will need all the mettearls to replicate this experment like the samples: marble, limestone, wood and plastic. And a scale to determine the mass before and after your experiment. And allow all the samples to sit and dry for the full 30 minutes. Then weight all the samples according to the mass.
2669	1	You would still need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, how much water you should use to rinse the sample for. You also need to know if you are working just at the procedure, what samples you would need to acquire.
2670	1	The procedure didn't state how much vinegar was needed to pour into each container. It also doesn't say what to label the container.The procedure also does not say how long to rinse the sample. All of these can change the data of the experiment if they are not all the same & stated in the procedure.
2671	1	In order to replicate the experiment  I would need to know the PH the vinegar because the PH of y different vinegar may vary. And I would need to know the approximate shape of the samples because if the limestone, for example has a greater surface area then it would corrode faster because more of its surface is touching the vinegar. Also I would want to know if the vinegar covers the sample completely in all three containers or not, because if a stone is only half covered by vinegar it does not corrod as fast as a stone covered completely by vinegar.
2672	1	This is a good procedure because they are keeping track of their procass that they get. At the starting mass marble9.8, ending 9.4, difference in mass -0.4. Starting mass limestone 10.4, ending mass 9.1, difference in mass -1.3. All they are doing is keeping track of the process they get.
2673	1	An additional piece of information would be how much vinegar to pour into the sample containers. It would be helpful the scietist to know which unit to measure the mass in (Kg, g,mg) and in step y. The time needed to rinse the samples would be needed, because the rinsing time could affect the results.
2674	1	To replicate this groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you should pour into each container. You would also need to know what types of containers to use before that and after the experiment. You would also need to know what size the samples should be.
2675	1	After I read the produre I came opon the conclution of getting another sample matiral to replicate this experiment.
2676	1	I would need to know what the containers were made of. What was the Ph of the vinegar was and how many trials to each sample were performed.
2677	1	One thing you would  need to know is what are the four different samples that we should use. Another you need to know to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to pour in each container. The last piece of information you might need to know is how to find the mass. In step 10 of the procedure they should have mentioned using a triple beam-balance scale or the type of scale they used. Without your experiment could be very different from theirs.
2678	1	"After reading the group's procedure, some additional information they would need to put in in order to replicate the experiment is firstly, what sort of container do you put the substance in to. Secondly, instead of saying, ""placing a single sample"", they should tell us a specific amount to put in each container. Next, in step 2, be more specific about the directions concerning the vinegar and lastly, they should tell us what the 4 different samples are of course."
2679	1	One piece of information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar (volume) in each container. Another piece of information I would need would be the temperature of the vinegar. For example, if the vinegar was warm it could cause the materials to decrease in mass more rapidly. Lastly, I would need to know the size of the four different containers. It would also help to know what materials those containers were made out of.
2680	1	To replicate the experiment additional information that would be needed is to determine the mass in grams, the type of sample, and the type of containers would all have to be identical.
2681	1	One of the informations needed at the beginning of the procedure is what are the four different materials we are dealing with. They also should have told if it was at room temperature. They did not say in the procedure if the container should be left in clear airy space or if it should be in a dark place.
2682	1	The additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is to know how much vinegar to pour in each containers, what the samples are that i'm testing and what do i weigh the stones on to get their mass.
2683	1	It would need to say in the procedures to have the starting mass. It would need to say, what these samples are. The procedure would also have to include that the students have to  find the differences in the masses.
2684	1	The three piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment are as follows the amount of each sample ex. how much marble?The amount of vinegar to immerse the samples and vinegar should be kept in ex' room temperature?
2685	1	I think the information you would need to replicate experiment is the starting facts.
2686	1	After reading this groups procedure, they need to tell me what kind of samples, stone. They also needed to tell me to take the mass of the samples before placing it with the vinegar. Lastly if the group told me to do more than one trial, the information would be more valid.
2687	1	If you were going to replicate it you would do the exact same steps but I would probably use four other samples and use something else instead of vinegar and I would probably have it be 35 hours not 24.
2688	1	First I would need to know how much vinegar was in each container then I would need to know the size of the container. I would also have to know what kind of samples they used.
2689	1	The additional information that i would add is which one has the most mass? and which one has the least mass and have a conclusion to the experiment.
2690	1	You would also have to include the type of sample, what the temperature should be, what do you do with the samples after the 30 minutes and how many trials this experiment should include.
2691	1	1. How much vinegar do you need to pour in. ^p 2. How large of a container is it. ^p 3. How long can you rinse the sample of water for.
2692	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of container the materials we put into. Also what was the lobor temperature at which the samples was done.
2693	1	After reading the groups procedure, four pieces of additional information that must be added to replicate the experiment are, the names of the four samples, the size of the containers, the amount of vinegar used for each sample, and there must be a control.
2694	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container also what kind of viniger to put into the container.
2695	1	First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. Also, we would need to know what material the containers should be made of, because if we use plastic containers, the substance could be affected the same way the sample materials are. Lastly, the procedure written by the students does not tell us what to use to remove the samples from the container nor does it place an amount of distilled water to use when rinsing the samples.
2696	1	I believed that I would need the controlled variable, independent variable, and the dependent variable. Because if you don't have these three thing their investigation not going to come at how they expect it. Thats the three thing  most important when you doing an experiment, or investigation.
2697	1	You would need to know how big the containers are. If you need to dry it in a cool or dry area, and how much vinegar you need to put in each container
2698	1	Some additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is (1) you could leave the sample in for alonger period of time. (2) you could allow the sample to dry for alonger period of time because some of the samples take longer to dry than others. Such as what it is harder to dry than marbles you can also try putting each samples in the same container and see what would happen.
2699	1	There need to be a part that says how much vinegar is to be put in each containers. How much of a sample to put in the vinegar and the experiment should say what the samples being tested are.
2700	1	If had to make a replicate of this experiment some additional information would had been. How much vinegar to add in each container and how much mass every sample (They all would read the same amount.)
2701	1	One additional information would be to know what the four different samples were. Another way for the information to be clear would be to tell how you going to measure the mass. Lastly it shouldnt be contains, you should know much of the different sample are in the contains. If it likes a graduated cylinder or something different.
2702	1	If I were to duplicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup. Without knowing how much vinegar to put into the cups the out comes would turn out very different.
2703	1	What could have been done is the should have told me how much Vinegar they put because what if they filled the glass on and I only put 1 tablespoon, The result will not be the same. And the third step is not clean, shouldn't there be an experiment involve like water because may be when samples have into content with a liquid that has changes.
2704	1	What I think should be additional to this procedure is see how they came out and looked. ^p The 7th part of the procedure see how the starting masses came out, the ending mass, and the difference in mass. ^p Also find out the averages of each sample.
2705	1	You would need to gets the materials the samples of morale, limestone, wood and plastic viniger and containers and step 7 record your results and also make a hypothesis befor you start doing any thing.
2706	1	Additional information that can be added is a control to see if any thing will happen to a certain rock without rinsing it or putting it in the acid rain in for a different time. Also, you can use at least one other sample of stone. The procedure can also include to have the person write a hypothesis or a safety guide.
2707	1	We must know how much vinegar is being put into containers to keep it consistent. We must make the surface areas of the samples equal. We must make sure the containers are the same material.
2708	1	The composit in of the sample, amount of each sample ,amount of vinegar to be poured.
2709	1	The procedure is missing a vital step. They need to write out how much vinegar they use for each sample. The amount should be the same used for all samples.
2710	1	First you would need to know the quantity of vinegar needed. That measurement is not given, and is essential to the experiment. Furthermore, the type of container is not given, for instance, should the vinegar be poured into a flask or beaker ? Finally, it does not say where to leave the container for the 24 hours. There could be a large difference in the out come if the container are left in a warm environment instead of a cold one.
2711	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you must pour vinegar in each of the four identical containers. Other trials so you can see if you get the same results for each sample. Then you can average, if you get different results. Have a control group and just ran distilled water with vinegar so you can compare the results with vinegar so you can compare the results with sample that have vinegar with them.
2712	1	They did not tell at what tempature the rock were in. They did not tell us how much vinegar was in each of the containers. They did not tell how long to leave the rock in the vinegar.
2713	1	"In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what materials to use, the procedure says ""Place a sample of one material"". But it never specifies what kind of material to use."
2714	1	I think you also need to know  how much time it took for each sample to derverse in mass.
2715	1	To be able to replicate this procedure you would need to include what types of samples you need, how much vinegar to use in each sample, you would also need to include what type of container you should use.
2716	1	The thing you would need is what to use for your four samples. They should also say what to use as containers. The procedure should also tell you what to label them and if there is a control.
2717	1	The students also & should shake, how much vinegar to use and where its lease the container such as on a window,on in the floor.
2718	1	The group would need to include the 4 different types of samples that they want you to weigh. You also need the amount of vinegar to put into the containers, the units of weighing needs to be included also, to determine the mass before & after the vinegar.
2719	1	In order to replicate this experiment in a more effective way you would need to state the materials you are testing in the procedure, establish as exact orient of vinegar, and ctaic the size of each container.
2720	1	After reading the groups procedure, describe what additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. Make sure to include list three pieces of information. I beleive they add the time differences and that's it.
2721	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should I use, what size should the container I use be, What sample should be used.
2722	1	The group should include finding the difference in mass in the procedure since it's part of the data table. They also should've weighed the samples before they let it dry because weight could've been affected by the drying process.
2723	1	The additional information you would need for this is how much of the materials you would need. The measurements and what exactly you are trying to figure out in the experiment. To replicate this experiment you would need vinegar in four separate containers. The samples that you are going to place inside. Marble, Limestone, Wood, Plastic.
2724	1	The students should have added in number 1, what king of samples they were weighing. They should have also added how much vinegar to put in the separate containers. In between number 1, and number 2 the students should have added to record the mass on data table, and after number 6 they should have done the same thing too.
2725	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, how much of each sample  to pour, what are the four different samples, where would I place the removed samples, and the specific materials I would need.
2726	1	To replicate this work you would need to know what four samples they used in this case marble,limestone,wood and plastic. You also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also you have to weigh the samples before putting them in the vinegar, you would need to know thees three things before you could replicate the experiment.
2727	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have more containers present. Then you would need more materials to put into the containers. Now lastly you would have to have the experiment go on for another 24 hours inorder to see if your results come out differently.
2728	1	The additional informatis is that we need to do in order and put very becarfully because the containers can broke and the them otther 24 hours we need to do all process very careful because something can go bad!
2729	1	The first thing you would need to know in order to replicate the experiment would be what the four different samples are. Another would be a list what materials you would need, also what kind of containers to put them in, and last where to keep them over the 24 hours.
2730	1	1. Measure the same amount of different samples that are marble, Limestone, wood and plastic ^p 2. In four different, but identical containers put the same amount of vinegar. ^p 3.Place a sample of one material in each container and label them. ^p 4.Repeat step number 3 for each sample. ^p 5.Leave the samples in a dry place for 24 hours. ^p 6. After the 24hours , let the samples dry for about 30min and then measure them.
2731	1	How mutch vinigar I needed to put in the comtaners, and what kined of contaner, and how much stone must be used.
2732	1	In Order to replicate this experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, how long to rinse each sample with distiled water, and what the four masses are.
2733	1	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is to tell what the four samples are in the statements. If we don't know what the samples are we can't do this experiment. They should've also included how much vinegar to use because it can affect the experiment.
2734	1	I would just replicate the procedure in order to replicate the students work.
2735	1	Additional information that would be needed to repeat this groups procedure would be the four different sample materials, what the mass of the materials would be , and how much vinegar to add to each container.
2736	1	LImestone 10.4.9.1.13 ^p Marble 9.8. 9.4.0.4 ^p Plastic 72.71.01 ^p Wood 112 112.00 ^p    I think the wood is the smallest because the difference in mass (E) was only 00.
2737	1	In order to replicate this experiment by reading the procedure,you will need to know how much vinegar is in each containers, what samples the group used and how much distilled water was used to rinse off the samples.
2738	1	The other additional information that I that it needs to be added is the amount of vinegar that was added to each sample. Also if they added water to the vinegar were the sample was.
2739	1	You would need what four samples they were testing, the amount of vinegar needed and what temperature the containers need tobe kepinin order to replicate this experiment.
2740	1	The information on in this procedure is not clearly stated. To replicate the experiment, the group needed to repeat what they did, the group also didn't list the four things being tested in the procedure. The students did not state what was in control.
2741	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar they poured
2742	1	Some additional information that can be added is of measuring time intervals. You could leave each of the materials in the containers longer than 24 hour like 48. You can see a larger difference in mass then. Another thing you could do is choose different materials other than the ones shown. One other thing you could change is the amount of time the samples sit and dry for as well as perhaps using a different liquid other than vinegar. This way you could determine if by using a different liquid a difference in mass would be shown.
2743	1	After reading the group's procedure, I would need at least three pieces of information in order to replicate that experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar  to pour into the containers, what samples to use (i.e what samples they used only looking at the procedure and not the data ),size of the containers they used. I would also  have a control using just  water and more trials. ^p (Answered question how it read because it asked after reading the procedure and not after reading the data table.
2744	1	In the procedure they need to determin what the 4 samples are, also they need to tell you axerectly how much vinegar and rock to put in. If there is to rock the vinegar won't break it down. It shold say in the procedure weither to us grams or Kg.
2745	1	Some additional information that you need in order to replicate this experement is how much vinegar you pour in each cup because if the distacin amount, ieeiccums are inaccurate. Also how much water or how long  do you need to rinse each object. Also for the experiment you need to use the same type of vinegar,  the size of each  cup, and the exact minutes shown.
2746	1	To replicate this experiment they need to tell us the controll. And list all the things that need to be kept constant like amount of vinegar, type of vinegar, the size of the cups.
2747	1	You would need to include what you measured the mass with. What kind of states were used and the last were of information what kind of vinegar was used when doing the experiment.
2748	1	Additional information that you would need to know if you wanted to replicate this expiramint is how much vinegar to pour into the 4 samples, how long you should rinse each sample with distilled water, and what are these 4 different samples also.
2749	1	You would also need to know how much of each sample they used, how much vinegar they used, how much distilled water they used and how much light was used on them to dry in order to replicate the experiment.
2750	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what it is the group is looking for (why they were doing the experiment), the amount of vinegar that is to be poured onto the substances, what kind of  containers to use and weather or not the samples needed to be calered while sitting in vinegar or not.
2751	1	To replicate the students experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size container to put the samples in and where I should do the experiment. Each of these would drastically change the outcome of the experiment. For example, if there was more vinegar in one container, that sample would have more nods.
2752	1	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be the types of materials used. They are not stated in the procedure. It would also be ideal to have the amount of concentration of vinegar in each container. The location of the containers is also important. The effect that the vinegar has may be different in different temperatures. The procedure should also determine to what decimal place the mass should be taken.
2753	1	The additional information that they would need is how big was the containee because it said that they pour vinegar into the container and left. Hover night they also needed it to add on where did they all it over night because was left somewhere for 24 hours. How did they determine the mass in the first place because they never said that they use anything to determine the mass in the beginning and end.
2754	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to indicate the amount of vinegar needed, what temperature is needed, and what safety requirement is necessary. Also what the purpose of the experiment is.
2755	1	We have to know all about how the mass change in marbel the starting mass is the 9.8 but, ending mass is 9.4 the difference in mass -0.4 we need to know how that happen how the mass change how mach time the mass take for change, but limestone starting mass 10.4, ending mass 9.1 difference 1.3 the question is how that happen why, because the vinage go into the nucleo of the morbel or afect at moss of the morbel, limestone, wood, plastic the.
2756	1	In order to repeat this experiment it is necessary to know how much vinegar is put into each container. Also the size and the shape of the container is needed. Additional it is important to know the exact PH of the vinegar being used. Finally it is important to know the size and shape of each material sample. Each of these would greatly affect the results.
2757	1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment, you need to know how much vinegar should be placed into the four identical containers, you need to make sure you remove the sample materials from each container at the same time and how much distilled water should be used to rise each sample.
2758	1	In order to replicate the expirment, one must first be more specific with the explaining in their expiriment. They should list the tools they used for each variable. Also, the students should be more clear with their steps. They need to more accurate with all of their data.
2759	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers you would also need  to know how the different samples are that  you are measuring the last peice of information needed is what materials are being used in the containers.
2760	1	The additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment, What the four samples are, wear safety protection and keep a data chart of the starting and ending mass and difference in mass.
2761	1	You need to know the specific amount of the sample you have in order to duplicate the experiment and the condiction that they preformed the experiment. Examples: temp is the room and of air pressure. You also need to know the materials included in this experiment.
2762	1	Well first of all it doesn't tell you how much vinegar to put into each. Cup you also need to know what materials we will need for the experiment. As well as how much water to use so it deposit  effect weight.
2763	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be have my samples as marble, limestone, wood, plastic all labled so I would now which was added the amount of vinegar. Another additional information would be test each one twice list to be sure and reliable enough for each sample.
2764	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the control is. Also, I would want to know if all the samples should have the same starting mass. Lastly, I would want to know how many trials to do.
2765	1	To replicate the experiment you would have to find new samples to put in the vinegar, you would also have to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar into the cups, but to change it alittle you could use a different kind of cup.
2766	1	After reading the procedure
2767	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container, how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and how I was to determine the mass of each sample.
2768	1	You would need a hypothesis
2769	1	They didn't specify the amount of vinegar they put in each cup. They didn't say what temperature they kept each cup at. They didn't say how much of each sample they put in the cup either.
2770	1	In Order to replicate the experiment, I would need some constants, what stays the same and a control. I would also need to know how to determine the mass of each samples and I would need o know where to put the samples, in a cold or warm environment, in the sunlight or darkness?
2771	1	In the procedure, you would need to include  what four types of samples and their weight. Also you will need to know how much vinegar to add into the containers and what type of a container those are included for this experiment.
2772	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what tools they used.Also, what the temperature was. Finally they need to tell you how much vinegar to use.
2773	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know what amount of material was used in the vinegar, how much vinegar was used, and at what temperature this samples were stored at.
2774	1	In the first step, describe how to find the mass, same with the last step.
2775	1	In the procedures it stated place a material into one container and label, should have listed the materials being used and write what happened over one day while the experiment was in affect.
2776	1	I order to replicate this experiment you would need another set of materials.
2777	1	I can't know
2778	1	In this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to use.
2779	1	The student's data recorded on the table is not enough to properly replicate the experiment. The table shows only the mass of the different materials but it should show other important pieces of data as well. The table should include how much vinegar was put into the containers, what type of container is being used, how long the samples sat in the vinegar and how long they were set to dry.
2780	1	In order to replicate the experiment there is a list of additional information needed in the group procedure to start, we would need to know to determine the mass so a sample in the procedure, it should sing to art a tripie bean bean balance and describe steps for calculating the mass. Also in order to complete it experiment wuld need to know the far different samples bring used. Next the procedure should include how much vinegar and the amount of each sample should be poured on container. Finally it would be helpful if we keep when and a containers and sting usd in the experiment and where should iuld plale that experiment to allow them to dry priority.
2781	1	In order to be able to ampete this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar you need to put into the containers, A second piece of information you need to know to what type of container to use, i.e glass or plastic, a third piece of information , measure for this experiment is how kg each sample should be.
2782	1	This procedure is very vague. First of all , all they say is '' four different samples,'' and then they don't even say what  the samples are or what of. Also, they didn't say how much vinegar to put in. In order to replicate the experiment, I need this information.
2783	1	The three pieces of information left out of these experiment instructions are as follows: First, what materials the samples are, second how much vinegar should be poured into each container; and third, in what way should the samples be removed.
2784	1	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do we need to use,how much of each material and what are the materials. Without knowing how much viniger it couldn't be accurate,because not every container would have the same amount,same with the materials. And the group doesn't list the materials in the procedure (what kind of tools),we need to know.
2785	1	I would need the time when this experiment was prefiber and when it was done. Also
2786	1	One piece of information needed to replicate this take is the amount of vinegar added to each containers. Another piece of information necessary is how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. Finally, you need to know where the samples should sit to dry. Without these pieces of information you cannot reaput the procedure.
2787	1	The main piece information is what type of vinger,  and how each of it. How much water should each sample to be rinsed with. Also, it was never mentioned what the sample should be. In the instances, you can tell that one needs marble, limestone, wood, and plastic by looking on the data table.
4492	2	They could of improved to remove the weights and clamp, and measure, the length of the plastic types.
4493	2	In conclusion the student found that the plastic types did stretch out considerably.Plastic stretched the most increasing in length 23mm,while plastic A stretched the least with 13mm.I think that the student should have included the original length of the plastic in data table included the original length of the plastic in the data table.This would give a better idea of what the test piece looked like and would help reader understand the experiment more another thing the student could have done was do more trials. In both trials conducted the amount the plastic stretched had changed so more trials make it clearer.
4494	2	A. Based on the student's data plastic type b was the stretchiest because it stretched the most amount.^p b. Are why to improve the experiment would be to make all the plastics the same length so they can be compared easier. Another improvement would be to add the same amount of weights to each plastic. If they were different it would affect how much the plastic stretched.
4495	2	A) Plastic type A (T1) increased by 2 (T2) plastic type B (T1) decreased by 1 (T3). Plastic type C (T3) decreased by 1 (T3) plastic type D (T1) stayed neutral as (T2). ^p B) The students could've improved their results if they let the clamps with weights on it to hang more than 5 minutes.
4496	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B has the most stretchability. T1=22mm T2=23mm. Plastic A only stretched T1-10mm T2=12mm. Plastic T1=14mm T2=13mm. Plastic D T1=20m T2=20mm. Plastic B stretched the most each trial and even attetched 1mm more from the T1 to T2. (B) The student could have improved the experimental design by saying how many weights will clamp on to each plastic and what you measure the length with.
4497	2	A) In conclusion it was plastic type B that stretched most, reaching an average length of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A, however didn't fare as well and stretched to an average length of 11 mm. Plastic D managed to stretch to 20mm and plastic type C was elongated to about 13.5mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improve the the conclusion of the experiment and the  validity of the results would have been by dictating a specific length that each polymer should begin as, and add a column to the data table saying what the change in length was for each plastic type.
4498	2	In the polymer investigation the type of plastic that stretched the most is plastic type B with a whole 22mm and on first trial beating types A,C,D with the most stretched and in 2nd trial stretching 23mm. This ways the students could have improved the experimetal design is that they could have the plastic before being stretched.
4499	2	From the data collected during this lab, it is evident that plastic type B & D are very similar in strength and are not  too compact. Plastic types A & C however are similar in strength  and very resistant to physical force.This lab could be improved simply bye standardising both the length on the plastic before testing and the weights applied to them.
4500	2	The conclusion that has been very noticeable is plastic type B had the most stretchable. Polymer plastic with trial 1 (T1) having 22 (mm), and Trial 2 (T2) having 23 (mm).
4501	2	Plastic D has the most stretchability and stayed the same for trial one and two. Plastic A has the least. The student  could have did at least two or more trials and could of add another plastic type.
4502	2	A) Polymer B can stretchtch most, In trial 1, it stretched 22mm, and in T2, 23MM. The least stretchable was polymer A, stretching 10 cm d 12 mm in trials 1 and 2 respectively. ^p B) The students could've improved their experiment by first, being specific about how much weight should be attached to the polymers. Next, they should measured the plastic under tension, because after the tenson is released it can unstrtetch
4503	2	My conclusions based on this experiment. Is that plastics A and B are the strongest plastics since they endured more than the other two bags. Two ways these kids could have improved their experiment is that they could have givin extra lenght to the tape and they also could've increase their expieriment to a trial 3.
4504	2	a) Based on my data my conclusion would be that B would be the matireal that streches the most.^p B) Student should always test experiment at least 3 times the procedure should of shown more detail like the weight amount they used or even what type of plastic material they used.
4505	2	"a) In my conclusion, when I stretched the plastic with the weights, the stretchiest plastic was type B. The firmest plastic trial stretched the least was type A. ^P b) The student should have included a statement problem because it was unclear in the purpose of this experiment. In step 6, the student should make the instruction more clear. For instance, they could have said something like ""repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining three plastics."
4506	2	In conclusion based upon the students data between trial 1 and 2 there has become a pattern for each A, B, C, D. The numbers go lower to high back to low and back up once more to high. For example trial 1 it goes A(10), B(22), C(14), and D(20). For trial 2 it goes A(12), B(23), C(13), and D(20).
4507	2	The conclusion based on the students data is that plastics A and B show an increase in the amount stretched between two trials, while plastics C and D show no increase in the amount stretched two trials. Two ways that the student could have improved the experiment is by identifying the type of plastic that he was testing, as well as conducting more trials to improve validity.
4508	2	a) Based off the students data, plastic type B was the one that was stretched out the most. I can say this because in the data table it says, B_22 (T1) +23 (T2). ^p b) The students could have done better is measure the plastic while it's hanging off the table. Lastly, they could have done is arrange the time, 5 minutes is too long, they should've done 3 minutes.
4509	2	a) According to the data, T2 was more successful because for plastic type A and B the amount stretched was more than it was in T1. In T2 the plastic was more stretched. ^p b) 1. The students could have used different clamps to see if it affected the stretch. ^p     2. They could have extended the time.
4510	2	A) In trial two, only plastic type A & B stretched more than trials 1, plastic type C & D either stayed the save of stretch. ^p B) Do more trials and test out different lengths of plastic
4511	2	Based on the students data plastic type B is the stretchiest because during both trials it stretched 22 & 23 mm which is more than the other 3 plastics. ^p The students would have improved the validity and experimental design by adding trials and making clear how much weight was hung from each of piece of plastic.
4512	2	a) It can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability. I say this because the amount it stretched was much more than the other plastics. ^p b) This experiment could be improved in a couple ways first, for the second trial the student should be sure to use another sample of that plastic. Another way this could be improved would be to a clamp for the top of the plastic instead of tape.
4513	2	From my results I can conclude that the plastic that was the most stretchable was type B. Plastic type B had the greatest lengthn in stretchability compared to the rest. Type D was very stretchable as well measuring 20mm in each trial, but plastic B measured 22mm and 23mm. One thing I would improve to this experiment is make sure all the plastics in the beginning are the same length. Second, specify how many weights are added to the clonp.
4514	2	Conclusion of this expirement would be that plastic type B was the polymer that stretched the most. Trial one it stretched 22mm and trial two it stretched 23mm. ^p One way they could improve the expirement is to record and keep the amount of weights added to the clamp for more valid results. They could also perform more than just two trials for a more valid results.
4515	2	A) My conclusion based on the student dat is that from A-C the thread goes up and on D they both are the same. ^p B) They could of counted how many weights they put & the time that they practice the 3 trials to show difference.
4516	2	Based on the data provided plastics A and C stretch almost half the amount that plastics B and D did. In conclusion plastics A and C are stronger and better for the use of grocery bags or food protection while plastics B and D are for when materials need to stretch. The validity of the experimental design is questionable. The students didn't give an exact weight for amount of weights to stretch on wich doesn't give accurate data. The student should've specified what types of plastic.
4517	2	(1) The students could do the experiment muti times and keep the temputure the same and the time and th ph. ^p (2) Make T2 different.
4518	2	a. You can conclude from this data that plastic type B is the stretchiest. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm. Plastic C stretched 14mm and 13mm, plastic D stretched 20mm and 20mm. ^p A way to improve this experiment would to have a control to hang off the table for 6 minutes. Also, you want to make sure the weight being added to the plastic is a constant weight.
4519	2	3. A) Based on the data, plastic type A is the most strechable. B)The student could have put the first measurement in the data table also a could have specifide how much weight was used.
4520	2	A conclusion that I can draw on the data is that plastic type B stretched the most & has the most stretchability, and type A has the least. Ways that the student could have improved their experiment is cutting all the types of plastic the same length, so they could start off the same. Another thing they could have improved is listing their Indepent & dependent variables. This is any conclusion about their lab.
4521	2	a) Based on the students results I'd have to say plastic type B had the overall best stretchability values while plastic type A seems not to qualify so much in this area.^p B) The student could have improved this experiment by specifying  the weight of each weight and how many weights to add to the clamp. The results are valid to extent. To make them more conclusive and higher their validity the student could have let the weights hang for different amounts of time for each trial.
4522	2	"In the polymer, lab plastic ""B"" is the strongest. Plastic type ""B"" stretched a total of 45mm, were plastic ""A"" only stretched 22mm in total. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to have more trials. Also, make the plastics begining measurement the same size."
4523	2	Based on the students data plastic type A, the amount stretched (mm) increase from 2 mm. Plastic type B amount stretched increase from 1 mm. Plastic type C amount stretched stayed the same.^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing 3 trials, and doing a control variable.
4524	2	My conclusion for this experiment is that the polymer used for plastic type A, made the plastic stretch more than others. This student could've labeled everything like the name of the plastic & polymers. Another thing was he didn't state the problem or question.
4525	2	"I conclude that both trial 1 and trial 2's results were almost identical. For plastic type A and B, trial 2 stretched fartiest. In plastic type C, trial 1 stretched further. Finally, in plastic type D, both trial 1 and 2 stretched 20mm. ^p They should have measured evry plastic type, not just 1. Step 8 should be, ""Record your data and make a graph."""
4526	2	Plastic type B stretches the most, while type A stretches the least. This experiment does not need improvement. It is fine the way it is. All experiments are beautiful in their own way.
4527	2	Two ways the students could have done better on their experimental design is one thing they should of instead of taking an example of one plastic, take a sample from all four plastics. Also the weight of clamped bass and had then put longer then give minutes.
4528	2	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the weakest because it streched the most and became deformed weight. Also I can conclude that plastic type A was the stronges because it really stretch and it held its form. Ways the student could have improved this experiment is by telling us what type of plastic it is, also making sure all plastic pieces are cut the same this way one doesn't have an advantage.
4529	2	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way the students could have improved their experiment is by making sure each type of plastic has the same length. Another way their experiment could have been improved is if the students did more trials.
4530	2	The datas not accurate because they did not said what the length it is there no control and there missing a third trial. ^p B) They should pick a length for the plastic and have a control.
4531	2	a) Plastic type B was very stretchy because it stretched 22-23 mm when weights were added to it. On the other hand plastic type A was the least stretchy because it only stretched 10-12 mm. B) One way to improve the the experiment is to specify how much weight is being placed on the plastic.Right now, that amount is unclear and may pose a validity issue. Another way to improve the experiment is to specify how long each plastic type is. They should all be the same length because if one is longer, there will be more of it hanging off the table which would make it a bit more stretchy, and throw off validity.
4532	2	(a) According to the student's data, the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B. In the first trial, it stretched 22mm. In the second trial it stretched 23mm. ^P (b) The student could've improved the experimental design by adding more trials. They also could've been specific on how many pounds to add on the plastic.
4533	2	Plastic type A was the least stretchy polymer and plastic type B was the most stretchy. The students could have improved the validity of the results by doing three trials instead of two and finding the average of all three. Also, they should have specified the amount of weights and that the same amount should be used for each plastic type because the results would not be valid if weight was another independant variable
4534	2	My conclusion based on the student data the amount of the plastic type, the first ways the student should have improved repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining of all plastic, the second one perform a second trial exactly like the first one.
4535	2	b)Two way the students could have improve this experiment is by adding more groups and repiting the experiment (trial 3) ^p A)Plastic type A is better than the others because during the 2 trials didn't stretch much as other one so that means that is better.
4536	2	a) The trials 1 and 2 differed in the amount stretched by increasing and decreasing at times.^p b) They should have done 3 trials not 2 and say repeat steps 1-5 not repeat exactly to do trial number 2.
4537	2	a) Plastic B has the best tensile stretch in compared to plastics A, C and D. ^p b. The students could do more trials and make sure the plastics are all the same type.
4538	2	The data shows that plastic type B is the most durable plastic out of all 4 of them. Some ways he could have improved were to have a 3rd trials. Also instead of using only 4 tipes of plastic he could have goten 3 or 4 more tipes.
4539	2	3. Based on the student's data plastic type D stretche the most.
4540	2	From the student's data you can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest and plastic type A is the least stretchy. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to increase the amount of trials and to increase the number of plastic bags tested.
4541	2	"Baced on the trial it showed that plastic type D stretched more then any of the other plastics. ^p Two ways they could have improved there lab would be measuring how far off of the table each piece should be ""messuring it so its the same"" and to add the some amount of weight to each plastic."
4542	2	a) All of the plastic stretched after 5 minutes of weights were hanging from it. The largest plastic streched was plastic B, it streched 22mm, 23mm. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are say the amount of weight used for the streching, and have another trial.
4543	2	From this data I can conclude that plastic D stretched the most, therefore it held the most weight. When weight was added, the plasticity in the plastic increased and began to stretch. ^p One way this student could have improved the validity of their results is by adding another trial to increase reliability. Another way this student could have improved validity is by adding different types of plastic, increasing the types of variables.
4544	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most, plastic D second most, plastic C third most and plastic type A stretched the least. I think the students could have improved their validity by hangin all the plastics next to each other and putting the same amount of weight on all of them at the same time and record how far each stretches before they snap.
4545	2	Based on the data on which plastic has the most stretchability, I can conclude that most of the plastics either got a little bit longer or stayed the same in trial 2 after 5 minutes. Also the C type plastic mights have gotten smaller because it was a stronger plastic and didn't want to stretch. Two ways the experiment could've been improved was by instead of using tape, they should've used  something stronger like mo's clamps. Also another way they could've changed the balance of the results would be to let the plastics hang longer than 5 min so they have more time to stretch.
4546	2	Based on the results plastic B had the most stretchability not of all of the plastic samples in Trial 1 being stretched to 22mm and in Trial 2 being stretched to 23 mm. The student heave specified exactly how many weights would be added to the clamp. The student also should have added a control to compare to the other plastics, for example a plastic sample that could not stretch.
4547	2	a) The experiment is being test on how the polymer plastics be affected on stretchability. The independent variable is the plastic type. The dependent variable is the amount of stretched. It's constant by repeating the same trial more than once. The data shows Trial 2 is best of amount stretched. The control is Trial 1. ^p b) Two ways the students have improved on the experiment is to repeat more and same timing.
4548	2	A) Plastic type D is the least stretchable and plastic type A is the most stretchable.^p B) The students should have explained how the weights should be added, it is unclear how or how much weight should be added. They should also make all the plastic pieces the same length making the data easier to read.
4549	2	From the data you can conclude polymer B is capable of being stretched the most and polymer A is the least. Improvements that could be made to this experiment are first, keep the amount or weights you add to clamp constant and also preforming more trials and changing your data would make the data more clear and accurate.
4550	2	Plastic type ''D'' consistently can strech the most according to these two trials. Therefore, plastic type D has the greatest stretchability.^p The student could have recorded of the plastic tapped or not how mush weight they were adding to the clamp.
4551	2	I think that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because it stretched the least in both trial one and two.This plastic only stretched an average of 11mm. I conclude that the plastic type A must have been cross-linked. Because it was the strongest out of all four of the plastic.The experiment could have been improved if they put one more trial for each plastic type and if they had a control variable.
4552	2	The amont stretched with the plastic type act time in increase more and more. If this could continue to happen the plastic will rip. ^p The student should it coded more details and information to it so it would made a clear.
4553	2	Based on the students' data, plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least. In trial 1, it stretched 10 mm and in trial 2, it stretched 12 mm. Plastic type D stretched the most; it stretched 20 mm each trial. The students should start out with all the plastic the same length and they should conduct more trials fo mor valid and accurate results.
4554	2	Based on the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most, 20mm. While type A was the least. Overall the data was accurate, both trials got around the same results. Although a third trial would have increased the validity. Also, the procedure is vague they should have included the difference types of plastic. The data table should also include the starting and ending lengths of the plastic samples.
4555	2	From the student's data I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched the least.^p One way the students could have improved their experimental design was establish a control and do more triao.
4556	2	The student make a data table to test the four different polymer plastics or stretchability. He di a data table, he put the plastic type A, B, C, D, and the amount stretched (mm), T1, 10, 2.2,14, 20, and T2, 12, 23, 13, 20. He use this table to find his answer. I think he could make a better explanation about the test he was supposed to show and explan.
4557	2	a.) The polymer with the most amount of stretchability is plastic type B. ^p b.) The group could have made sure each plastic was the exact same length. The also could have specified exactly how much weight to add befor letting the plastic hang for five minutes.
4558	2	4 types of plastic were tested A, B, C, and D. Type A was 10mm then it was stretched to 12. Type B was 22 than stretched to 23mm. Type C was 14 than stretched back to 13mm. Type D was 20mm and it stayed the same. Next time he could have done another trial to verify the results again. Then extend the amount of time and weight compare the 3rd trial to the 1st, 2nd trial and see the outcomes.
4559	2	"Based on the students data, the plastic type ""B"" stretched the most out of all of them.^p The student could have used new plastics for the second trial and could have done more trials to verify the results."
4560	2	Based on the students data the amount stretched between test and test 2 their isn't much of a difference because they are either off by one or two millimeters or it didn't change at all. Two ways the student could have improved is ran more tests and test more types of plastics.
4561	2	The conclusion on base or the student's data is that B have the most amount stretched (mm) D have 90 (mm) lC 2Y (mm) A=22 Amout stretched (mm). ^p by telling us what type or plastic and by explaining  better how to do it.
4562	2	A) The type B plastic was the most stretchable because the first test it streched 22mm and the second it stretched 23mm. This was more than any other plastics. ^P B) The students could have added one more test to the experiment to get more accurate data. Also the should have had the same amount of weight on the plastics for more accurate data.
4563	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B has the most stretchability out of these 4 polymer plastics, and type A has the least. b) To improve this experiment, the student could've specified how much weight was added to each clamp, and he could've added a control group so he had something to compare the results against.
4564	2	Plastic type D stretched the most out of all of the plastics because it stretched 20mm in both (T1) and (T2). Plastics A, B, +C stretched an average of 11mm, 22.5mm and 13.5mm respectively. ^p One way the experimental design could be improved is by specifying how much weight is to be clamped on the plastic in step 4 (to increase validity). Also, the lengths of the plastics should be kept constant throughout all the trials.
4565	2	A conclusion that can be made from this experiment is plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched the largest amounts in both trials with 22mm and then 23mm. This plastic probably is not the strongest because it stretched a lot. Plastic type A only stretched 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. The student could have tested the plastics with weights at various amounts of time, not just 5 minutes. Also the student could have tested each plastic more than once to increase the validity of the results.
4566	2	a) Based on the students' data, one could conclude that polymer plastics B and D stretched more than A and C being stretched the most and A being stretched the least amount. ^p b) The students could improve this experiment by measuring the plastics normally, as they did, but then was completely stretching the material by weights or by hand and measuring if a completely stretched rather than after measuring it. Also, because some results varied, then they could have performed another time to ensure accuracy, and then find the average.
4567	2	According to the student's data, type B stretch the most. In both trials, this plastic proved the most stretchable. However his data is partially invalid because a) if different length plastics are used a larger length will always be measured more than a shorter length plastic. Also, the amount of weights need to be constant because the amount of weight used can greatly alter how stretched the plastic.
4568	2	a) In conclusion plastic type A stretched the most and plastic type D didn't stretch at all. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved is by doing more trials and by saying the amount of weight that used on the plastics.
4569	2	(A) Plastic type B was the most stretched in (T2).^P (B) These could have on the experiment over to doble check their work and made sure type C was correct.
4570	2	One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic B is the strongest. Two ways that the student could improve the experiment design and/or the validity is to specify how much weight to add on the clamp and to make sure all of the samples are the same size.
4571	2	A.) We conclude that plastic type B had stretched the furthes in both trial 1 and trial 2. As you see in the data table plastic B stretched 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by increasing the amount of trials and have a specific number of weights instead of just adding a random amount.
4572	2	a. According to the table between plastics A, B, and C the amount stretched increased by 2, increased by one; and decreased by 1, but D stayed the same. ^P b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are more types of plastic bags and repeat the procedure.
4573	2	Based on the students data polymer plastic type B is stretches the most. Plastic type B had the longest amount stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment is to have added the same amount of weights to each clamp. Another way to improve the experiment is to make sure all the plastics are the same length in the beginning of the experiment.
4574	2	After reading the students data on the polymer investigation, I can conclude that plastic A is the strongest polymer because it only stretched 10 mm in T1 and 12 mm in T2 and plastic B is the most flexible because it stretched 22 mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by adding a control to compare the results to, and specify how much weight to hang on the polymers.
4575	2	a) Plastic B stetched the most, followed by plastics D, C, and A stretching the least. ^p b) 1) measure the distance the plastic is laped from the edge of the table and keep consitent for all the plastics. 2) Specify the amount of  weight added to the clamp and keep consistent for all the plastics.
4576	2	"Based on the data polymer B had the largest stretchability. ^p b)"" The Student could have done one more trial to ensure accurate results . 2) Make sure the tape is the same place for each sample so that it gives the same support and more accurate answers."
4577	2	(1) They should make different trials.^P (2) They should use clamps it messis thing up.
4578	2	Based on the data, it is evident that overall plastic B was the most stretchable and plastic A was the least stretchable. Polymer A possibly has a cross-linked structure since it is more rigid and strong, while polymer B is probaly liner or branched in structure. One way the student could have improved the validity of the results could be to cut the plastics to equal size. This way, length would be a constant. Also, the experiment's procedure does not specify the mass of the weights if the mass was kept constant for all of the tests, the results would be much more valid.
4579	2	Based on this student's data the plastic type B stretches the farthest while plastic type A stretches the least amount. To improve the students results it would be important to add a control to the experiment. Another way to improve would be to add additional trials to the experiment to increase the validity of the results.
4580	2	Based on the student's data, I concluded that plastic type B had the highest stretchability because it stretched 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2, which was more than all of the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment/validity of results could be to 1) Conduct a 3rd trial to get more accurate results, and 2) Specify what polymer plastics were used so that someone could accurate the experiment.
4581	2	A)Based on the data table, if you add weight to plastic types while it is hanging, some of the thin plastic type will get longer. during the times in the experiment it does not longer. ^p B) In step four the students should have told you how many weights to add to the types of plastic. The student should have measured the plastics before they stretched them. This would help with the validity of the results because you will be able to compare its regular length to the stretched length to help your conclusion.
4582	2	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the strongest plastic. ^P They can improve this experiment by having more trials. Also they can add more weight for another three trials to be sure that their results were accurate.
4583	2	The student should of used a foamcup instead of a plastic one and also used beaker weights and a clamp that was made for experiments like these. It would of made is data come out with a lot of better results.
4584	2	B is the most stretchable plastic out of all four. One way to improve it is saying how much weight they used on each one and if the changed it. The second way would be to test four or five different ones.
4585	2	Based on the experiment, I draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the strongest. This is because plastic type A stretched the least of all the plastics in trial 1 and 2. To improve this experiment the students could do more trials, this would make their finding more valid. Also, the student's don't provide the initial length of each piece of plastic, which makes conclusions like mine possible incorrect.
4586	2	In conclusion plastic type B is the most that was stretched out the all the others. Something the student could have done better is tell us how much weight he put them to make it stretch out.
4587	2	Based on the students experiment, the conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic b is able to stretch the most millimeters in both trials 1 and 2. One way the students could have improved the experimental design of their experiment is by saying what size weight they had used for each plastic. The last way is by saying what type of plastic they used.
4588	2	Plastic D was the most streched. ^p The student could it should wat the original mesurment was of the plastic before streched
4589	2	A) In conclusion, the type of plastic that stretched the largest is B. The amount B has stretched was T1-22, and T2-23. ^P B) Two ways they could of improved their experiment was one add weights, and repeat the trial a few more times.
4590	2	Base on the data, all four plastic for T1 is different from T2. Each trial follow the same procedure. It should be right on the same amount that mean the trial is wrong.^p B) Student can read and go throught everything to proved on their project. Student should write down everything that they done each trial.
4591	2	"Plastic ""D"" stretched the same amount every time. Plastics ""A"" and ""B"" increased when they stretched. Plastic ""C"" decreased when it stretched. ^P The students could have done an experimentnal for each polymer."
4592	2	A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B has the highest stretchability, while plastic A has the least stretchability. Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by specifying the weights of weights, and use the same amount for each trial. Another change would be to conduct at least one more trial, these improvements would greatly improve validity of the results.
4593	2	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable of all the plastics, while type A is the least stretchable. ^P b. The first way would have been for the students to have defined the weight of the weights. Also, the before and after lengths of the weights should have been defined.
4594	2	My conclusion on the students data is that plastic C always had the most stretchability. 2 ways the students could've improved the experiment was to leave it hanging longer and use a little more weights.
4595	2	Based on the data given by the students, all of the plastic wraps stretched approximately the same amount for both trials 1 and 2. One way the students could have improved the validity of their results is by adding a section to the table that showed what the starting length of the plastic wrap were. Another way is that in the experimental design, the amount of weights added could have been more specific.
4596	2	Plastic types A and C didn't hold very well. However plastic B and D held more. I say that plastic B as the better solution and outcome to use because pt adds more and pt has a good stretch.
4597	2	a)Plastic type B has the most stretch.^p (B)The student could add more trials, and the student could make sure to use the same size samples for each trial.
4598	2	3. A) In conclusion it shows that plastic B can hold more weights than the others. Trial 1 only stretched 22mm and Trial 2 stretched 23 mm. ^p B) Two ways the student can improve is the number of weights applied to the plastic bag. Also the amount of time it took for the bag to rip added more time.
4599	2	a). Based on the students results a conclusion that can be drawn is plastic  type B has the highest stretchability. ^p ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment was state mass of the weights.^p ^p c) Another way the students could have improved the experiment was to ensure the same mass of the weights were used for each type of plastic type.
4600	2	"(a) My conclusion is that T3, plastic type ""A"" will be 14, ""B"" 24, ""C"" 12 and ""D"" 20. ^P (b) A way the students could've improved is by having a particular time limit for all of the trials. Another way to improve is by having a certain amount of weights so the data can be more accurate."
4601	2	The conclusion I can make of the student's data is plastic type B has highest strechability and plastic type A has the lowest strechability. This experimental design could have been improved by letting us know how many weights he used for each plastic types. He or she also could have told us how long was the length of each type of plastic was used.
4602	2	The gradually increase with cartion plastics A and B and C and D either remain the same is get changes. One way to improve the experiment would be to explain what type of plastics they're using. Another could be to repeat the trials more than twice.
4603	2	After reading the students data I have come to a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the most on both trials because it has 22 and 23 which is higher than the other plastic types they investigated.
4604	2	In conclusion, If type A, B, C and D are stretched then type B plastic will stretch the most since it stretched about 20-23mm. Then the type A plastic will stretch the least since it stretched about 10-12mm, one way the student could improve design is do one trial without weights to assure the plastic will not stretch from gravity's force or other elements. next, the student should have made each plastic the same length because with different length a second length is present. Finally, in the procedure the students should use the same amount of weights for each trial and plastic.
4605	2	Plastic B is the polymer plastic that had the biggest amount of stretch. One way that could improve this experiment is when you and the weight use a certain amount alot than next trial and more weight . Another thing that can improve the result of the experiment is to you do a third trial.
4606	2	One way the student could have improved the experiment is instead of performing a second trial exactly like the first one they could have switched up a little to make it more interesting. Another way the student could have improved the experiment is used other objects other than only weights.
4607	2	The student could have put more weights on the clamp to let the plastic be more stretchable and it would get more big and it could hole more thing.
4608	2	Type 1 was lower on numbers in mm compared to type 2, but type 1 was more consistant. Also, plastic B was stretchyess. ^p The student could or improved by steching it out, to visualize it better. Also, you can never for get labels, and variables.
4609	2	a) Out of all the plastics B has streched the most and looks as if it want go any further. The least strechable is A plastic. ^P b) Two ways they could of improved the experiment is by doing a T3 and/or try different amounts of weight and ice if done more each time makes a difference.
4610	2	Plastic B is the most stretchability, plastic A is the least. The students should have changed the amount of weight put on each plastic. The plastics could have stretched hore depending on how much weight they can use. The students should also have done a control and let the plastic half with that the lamp.
4611	2	A conclusion  I drew about the students data is that plastic A stretched more in trial 2 than trial 1. Also that in trial 2 plastic B stretched 1mm than trial 1. In trial 2 for plastic Cit didn't stretch as much as trial 1 at trial 1 and 2 plastic D stretched the same. The student could have improve their experiment is by adding a clamp at the top and bottom of the plastic sample. Another way the students experiment could have been improved is trying a third trial.
4612	2	a) The conclusion of the students results is that plastic type B was able to stretch the farthest without increasing.^p b) 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment are to say:What wait to measure the plastics in,in the procedure. What the procedure you are adding weigh.
4613	2	Plastic type D stayed the same throughout the trail. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by being more spefic with the weights (ie are they 50g or 100g) and explain how they are going to mesure the plastic samples.
4614	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchable followed by plastic type D, then C, and finally A. The student could have made the procedure better if they had specified the origional length of the plastic and by adding one more trial, it could have further solidified their results.
4615	2	a) In both trial one and two had stretched the less B had strached more than any other in both trials. ^p The student could have improved improved the experimental design, he or she could have added the length they started with. Also they could have made th length start the same. It would have come out better.
4616	2	In conclusion, plastic type D will be stretched the most in the data. I have found because in both trials it has 20mm stretched. ^p Two way the student could have improved their procedure is by having the same type of length for each plastic type in the begining and second they should preform the percedure at the same time as the other plastics.
4617	2	(A) Based on the students results, I can conclude that the B plastic is the stretchiest because it stretched the most when its trials trials lengths were averaged. ^p (B) One way they could have improved their design was to make sure the same weight was on each plastic sample, and to do three trials for each plastic rather than two, to make their results more valid.
4618	2	"After understanding the table, I came to conclude that polymer plastic ""A"" has the highest strechability level. One way this lab can be improved is by taking into consideration the weight of the clamp that stays constant wen adding it to the calculations of the weight on the polymer plastic. Also, more trials could or been done."
4619	2	In conclusion, type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type B is the weakest. Type C and D are in the Middle but D is mater and dose to B. ^p One way of improving this experiment I could be testfy more plastics. Also the student would of change the same from 5 to 3 or any other time.
4620	2	Based on the data, my conclusion will be that the students did something wrong with plastic type C and D. Two ways this experiment could be improved  is adding another trial and stating the amount of weight they used on the plastics.
4621	2	The data is inconclusive because there is no controlled test in the experiment. The student could have improved by including a list materials. He/she should also have been more specific such as say be what units to measure in and how many weights to use and how big/small they are. He/she should have also had a control and labeled which types of plastics used.
4622	2	A. The hypothesis in this experiment can not Be supported Because there was not one stated the plastic type that stretched the most was type B which stretched an average of 25mm The plastic that was most resistance to stretch was type A which stretched an average of 11mm. ^p The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by having more trials and by telling you how heavy the weights are supposed to Be.
4623	2	Everything went well and they eat everything the wanted. Two ways that the students can improve on their experiment is they maybe do more experiments instead of doin 3. The next thing that they can improve in is not taping the edge and seeing what happens when they don't so that is what they can improve on.
4624	2	A conclusion based on the students data is T1 and T2, A, B, C, and D weigs a close. There in the same area. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is if they were to let it hang then five minutes and if you were to attach something other then a clamp.
4625	2	a.) The Conclusion is. ^p B.) The students could have improve their experiment by adding a weight to each trials they do. They can also  compare both plastics to see, which one is stranger, or strech the longest.
4626	2	Plastic type D is the most streacable. The student could have shown the amount of height put on the plastics. Also they could have added more trials to make their results more percise.
4627	2	a) Based on the student's data of the stretchability of polymers, plastic D stretched the farthest. Also, the other plastics stretched 1-2mm more during the second trial, but plastic D remained at 20mm. ^P b) The student could have improved in their experimental design and validity. For example, in the procedure, the student should have state more clearly whether he or, she used the exact piece of plastics for each trial. Also, the student could have included what each plastic was.
4628	2	The conclusion for the student's data is that slightly two went up, one went down, and one stood the same. First way students could improve is by adding different kind of weight. Another way is by changing the length of the plastic.
4629	2	A) In this conclusion plastic type D stretched the least T1 and T2 times(mm). Then plastic type B which stretched about 22 to 23 for T1 and T2. ^p B) They should have mentioned the safety procedure what should be worn when doing this lab. They should have also mentioned how many minutes each should have.
4630	2	The student could of done a graph to improve the experiment design. The student could of also done an experiment or maybe could of drawn the process.
4631	2	(A) I can conclude from this data that plastic A is harder to stretch and that plastic B is easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways the student could improved the validity of the results are to start with the same lenghts of each plastic and to add equal amounts of weight to each plastic.
4632	2	a) Based on the students data plastics.Type D had most strechability plastic. Type A had the lowest strechability. B) One way to improve the experiment could be to have more thats. Another way could be to manually stretch plastic rather than using weights.
4633	2	a)Based on the data the amount  stretched was not much of a difference.^p (b)Two ways the experiment could have been made improved is they could have made the trial longer and added a 3rd trial. Also, they could have used a control.
4634	2	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data of the experiment is that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic of the four plastics. One way that the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing about three of four trials instead of just two. This is because by doing more trials, you can see if you might have made an error compare in the experiment if the data you collect doesn't seem reliable. The second way the students could have improved their experimental design is by identifying which polymer plastics are which. This is important because people need to know the name of the polymer plastic to be able to understand the experiment.
4635	2	My conclusion from the data is that man time the plastic was stretched the second time they stretched longer because after the first time it was very loose and worn out. Two ways they could have improved was by trying third time but with different objects to stretch the plastics and by trying different plastics for each trial.
4636	2	Based on the data shown, plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the design of the experiment is by then taking each polymer and seeing how much weight could be used to stretch it  how far. One more way to improve the flexibility of the experiment is by making sure that the plastic is taped in the same flow. Every time, so the amount hanging of the table is constant.
4637	2	a) My conclusion based on these students data would be that plastic type B stretched the most on both trials. ^p B) One way they can improve their experiment is by again including a control another way is to add more time instead of letting the plastic hang there for 5 mins try like 7mms.
4638	2	I think that plastic B is the most stretchy because on trial 1 it is the longest and trial 2. They could've said how much weight they put on and they could've put how much plastic they used.
4639	2	Could at made a better chart or make a better way to solve it.
4640	2	In conclusion it seems that type A, B had stretched about 1mm. Type C+D, had other plans. For type C the tape shorten about 1mm, and type D, didn't stretch at all. ^p Two ways 1. Name the type of tape they are using. 2. Add the measurements in the table.
4641	2	I can conclude from the students experiment that plastic type A is a lot stronger then any of the other plastic because  on the second trial it stretched a whole 2mm more than it did in the first trial. One way the could have improved their experiment is to do another trial. Also they could have added the same amount of weights to each type of plastic to improve validity.
4642	2	A) I concluded that the plastic type B was strongest, type D was second, third was C and 4th was plastic type A. ^p 1) He should have recorded the leangth of teh plastics before the weight was added. 2) He should have use all the same weights to screen the plastic.
4643	2	"In this experiment it is shown that plastic bag ""B"" has a higher stretchability then any other bag because in trial 1 it received 22mm and in trial 2 it received 23mm; these amounts of plastic stretched were higher then any other bag. Bag ""D"" was the closest in range to bag ""B"" receiving 20mm."
4644	2	A student performed an experiment to see how the amount of weight affects the type of bag. The bag that worked the best in both of the trials was bag B, it stretched to 22mm and 23mm. The bag that did the worst was bag A. stretching only 10mm and 12mm. The student could have improved their experimental design by saying what types of plastics they were using. They also could have made their results more valid if they had a control.
4645	2	A conclusion of those results is that type D plastic appears to be the strongest because; it stretched the least and type A is the weakest because it stretched the most. ^P Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by being more specific with how much weight they should add in step 4. Also, the should have re-tested trial 2 of plastic type C because their results show that it shrank instead of stretched which is impossible in this experiment.
4646	2	I concluded that plastic type B stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. They could have improved the design or validity by using weight that all weigh the same and by making sure that all four types of plastics were taped at the edge of the table in the same spot.
4647	2	a. Plastic A is the best plastic to use because it is stronger than the rest of the plastics since it stretched the least. ^p b. 1.Could have done 3 trials instead of just 2. 2. Said how much weight was used on each plastic.
4648	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the groups data is that their results are not very valid but plastic type B was the strongest. One way the student could have improved his/her experiment design is to be more specific and clear with his/her procedure. Another way this student could have improved his/her experiment is to conduct is trials instead of 2 to get more valid results.
4649	2	The two ways the students have improved the experiment was to not repeat the trial for a second time.
4650	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most.  ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design by putting the number and weight of the weights, and putt the original lengths of the plastics.
4651	2	The type A drastic appears to be the more resistant to stretching while type B seems the most prone to stretching. To better improve the lab they should use equal starting length for all the plastic types. They could also use a better adhesive than tape so that there is less of a chance the plastic might only down and give inaccurate results.
4652	2	NSR.
4653	2	"A conclusion for the investigation is that plastic type ""B"" is the most strechy.Two ways the student could have improved the data would be either on trial 2 is to have the plastic are same size way one plastic wouldn't have an unfair advantage over another.Another way is to get new plastics,for the new trial so you wouldn't mess up the data with the already plastic."
4654	2	Polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable. Polymer plastic type B stretched 22mm in its first trial and 23mm in its second. It stretched 3mm more than polymer plastic type D which stretched the second furthest at 20 mm in both trials. ^P The student could have improved the validity of the results by saying how heavy the weights need to be. The student could have also improved the validity of the results also by saying what unit to measure in so no one accidentally measures in the wrong measurements.
4655	2	"A conclusion that can be drawn from the student's data is that, plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials. The student could have improved their experimental design by including exactly how much weight to use instead of just saying ""weight."" Also, they could have waited more than five minutes in order to get better results."
4656	2	He should control the amount of weight he is putting on the plastic. He should also use different types of plastic.
4657	2	Plastic bag (B) was the strongest bag while (A) bag was the weakest. The student could of did more trials and tell us what he had to do keep the exirement going.
4658	2	"a.) Based on the data recieved from the students table I can conclude that plastic type ""B"" was the one that stretched the most. It stretched 22mm and 23. Also plastic type ""A"" was the best and barely stretched. It came in at only 12mm and 10mm. ^P b.) To improve the experimental design they could have explain how to secure the clamp and weights to the plastic material, and they could have told us how large the piece of plastic must be to do this experiment."
4659	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be if we tested four different plastics to see which one had the most stretchability then plastic B would stretch the most. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are; one, they could have repeated it a third time to make sure everything was correct and their were no anamulies. Another way they could have improved the experiment is they could have made sure they had an equal amount of weight on each plastic sample.
4660	2	Based on this students data on stretchability of plastics, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most or had the most stretchability after being weighed down for 5 minutes. Two ways this student could have improved the experiment and its results could be first, using a set number of weights to add to the clamp not just adding as much as possible. Secondly, the student should have made a control of how long each piece of plastic was (in mm) before its stretchability  was tested.
4661	2	a) A conclusion can be drawn that plastic type B was the stretchiest  based on the data, and that it would be the most durable. ^p b) Two ways they could improve the experiment would be to control the amount of weight added and to control the length and width of the plastics. Wider and longer plastics would most likely be stretchier. So this adds another variable to the experiment. If more weight is added to one substance than another then the plastics would less easier.
4662	2	Based on the students' data, table 1 can concluded that plastic type B stretched out the longest than any of the the plastics.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by first identifing what she used as weights to hold down the plastic and the second way is to possibly do a third trial of doing this experiment because the amount of plastic stretched was so close in the first two trials.
4663	2	The second trial the length of cup increased compared to first trial.^p The student could've done more trial just to have better data.
4664	2	The conclusion of these student would be that plastic B had the greatest stretchability out of all the plastics with 22mm in trial 1 and 23 in trial 2. One way the students could have improved the validity of the results would be to include the actual total weight of the weights and that also that constant throughout the experiment. The other way to improve result would be to also include the starting weight or length of the plastic and keep that constant for all of the other plastics.
4665	2	A. Based on the data gatherd the best polymer in plastic A stretch ability would have to be plastic B because it stretched the most. ^p b. He could have improved it's validity by recording the measure of its length before he began the experiment.
4666	2	I think plastic type B will stretch the most and two ways the student can improve this is they could do more trial and let them hang longer.
4667	2	Plastic type B stretched the farthest because in trial 1 it streched 22 mm, and trial 2 streched 23 mm. The student could've, put in the table mm per minute so it would be more accurate or he/she could've made a graph to show per minute, how each plastic streched.
4668	2	It appears that plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least to improve their experiment they should have done a third trial and instead of attaching a clamp to just one corner there should be another clamp in the other corner to make it even.
4669	2	Based on the data table I can conclude that plastic A is the most stretchable. One  way the student could have improved the experimental design is to measure carefully, and to conduct more trials.
4670	2	In the experiment done by the student, it appears that plastic type B was the stretchiest, on average 221/2 mm. Ways the student would be making all the initial plastic samples the same length before hand, and specifying how much weight to put on the clamp.
4671	2	a) In conclusion, the experiment worred effectively because cor plastic type A and B, the plastic stretched from 10mm in trial 1 to 12mm in trial 2, and plastic B stretched from 22mm to 23mm. ^p b) This experiment can be improved by including constant or a control such as the initial length of each plastic. The validity of this experiment can also be improved by including more trials.
4672	2	a) The student's data was very relative it showed the types of plastic used and how much it had streched afterward. Their data for trial one was close to their data for trial two. For example in T1 for plastic A it streched 10mm, in T2 for plastic A it streched 12mm, therefore their data was acurate.^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity are to add a third trial and to be more specific about adding weights. Tell us how many and how much they weigh.
4673	2	After testing 4 different plastic samples two times ti find which one stretched the most we found that plastic B stretched the furthest 23mm. One way the students could improve their design and or validities could be by naming the types of plastics they used. Another could be by trying the experiment with different sized weights to see if that causes the results to vary.
4674	2	Based on the data, plastic B stretched the most, 23mm. That proves that the polymers are ductile. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic A, but plastic C was only 1 mm longer than plastic A. Plastic D was in between plastic C and B with 20 mm stretched. There could've been error with how the student clamped or pulled the plastic. One way the student could've improved the validity of their results would be doing at least 3 trials. Another way the student could've improved experimental design would be by in the procedure telling what plastic to use first.
4675	2	a) Plastic type B is the most durrable because it stretched 22mm the first time, & 23 mm the second time. The average is 22.5 mm, which the greatest average coting all of the plastic types. ^P The student could have done more trials to improve the validity of the experiment. The student could also make the plastics are all of the same length, to improve the validity also.
4676	2	In the student data all of the plastic type
4677	2	a) I can conclude that plastics B & D are the most stretchable because of the length of their plastic in the end. ^p b.) They should have made the procedure more clear. For example 5 kilo on the procedure needed to be more specific on whether or not the weights should stay removed. Also, they should have kept all 4 plastics in the experiment the entirely of the time because it was misleading inaccurate, and alogical to keep one out. Add 1 more trial would suffice.
4678	2	a) Plastics D and B are weaker than plastics A and C. A is the strongest plastic and B is the weakest.^p B) The plan does not mention how the plastics should be measured. Also, the plan does not say to use different types of plastics.
4679	2	A. You can conclude that plastic B is the most strechable. ^p B. They could have improved their experiment if they said haw much weight they used and stated the initial length of each plastic.
4680	2	(A) Based on the students data I can tell that plastic type D is the most consistant. It stayed at 20mm's each trial. C is the weakest because in the first trial it held 14mm, and in the second it only held 13 mm. ^P (B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do it for a third time and to say the weight of each weight.
4681	2	Polymer investigation (draw a conclusion based on student data.
4682	2	The conclusion of this experiment would be that test two mostly stretched further likely because the plastic is already stretched from test one. ^p They could have improved the experiment by doing both trials with the same time to see the difference between the two. Also they could have used different plastics for both trials so it wosnt  previosly stretched from trial 1.
4683	2	a) The conclusion you can draw is that plastic type B has the best stretchability out of the 4 plastics. ^p b) The student should have said how long the plastic was when they first ripped it off. The student could have used all different lengths, therefore making this not valid. Also the student could have done more than 2 trials to make the experiment more valid.
4684	2	Seeing from the students data table a conclution I can draw is that plastic type D is the strongest material and most stretched. ^p They could have improved by using an additional step for recording their data. Also, they could have used the same length plastic to begin.
4685	2	Based on this data, plastic B stretched the most, since for both trials, it stretch further trials, any other plastic. Plastic A is the least stretchability according to the experiment, because for both trials it stretched the least. A way to improve the experimental design would be to specify the amount of weights, so each plastic can receive the same amount of weight . Another way to improve the experiment would be to have each plastic start at the same length so theng can better be compared.
4686	2	a) A conclusion of the data would be that sample B is the one that stretches the most. Also based on the experiment plastic type A did the least amount of stretching and plastic type C didn't stretch as much rather sample D did pretty well but it stretched the same amount both trials. ^p b) The experiment could have been better if it was repeated again. It would have been better also if the plastic length would have been more specific.
4687	2	Plastic type B has the highest stretchability because it stretched the farthest at 22mm and 23mm for five minutes in trials 1 and 2. Plastic type A has the lowest stretchability only stretching 10mm inT1 and 11 mm in T2. The student could have improved the experiment by making each plastic sample the same dimensions. Also for each sample the clamps and type should be part in the same spot, height, amount should be specified.
4688	2	Looking at the data, I cant see that the amount stretched only changed by a little, but for plastic type D it remained the same in both trials. They could have improved it by saying ''how heavy the weights should be.'' Another way the kids could have improved it was to say what type of plastic did they use.
4689	2	The conclusion that can be identified from this investigation is that for the plastic type D in both trials the amount stretched were the same. Two ways the student could've improved his or her experiment is by expanding the trials to see if they turn out the same again. Another way is to add the same type of weight for each one or change the place where the weights were put on the plastic bags.
4690	2	In conclusion based on the data the best polymer or plastic type would be plastic B because it stretched the farthest with the weights. One way the could improve was by reducing the time (5 minutes) and instead repeat the weights three which each plastic type or they could also done trial 1 taped to the desk and trial 2 holding by your hand.
4691	2	Conclusion: plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched the least. Two ways to improve this experiment would be to include the original length of plastic and also the weight of the clamp and weighls.
4692	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic type A was the least stretchable. ^p The student should have, this procedure, used the same amount of weight on each plastic. Also, the student could have stated trials that were longer than 5 minutes toseeif time affected stretchability.
4693	2	The conclusion I can draw from this data is that plastic type A was the most stretchable. It stretched 22 -23MM. Plastic type B was at least stretchable. ^p The ancient could have improved the experiment by including the amount of weight that was clamped so the plastic. They could have added a control where were was no weight added to the clamp.
4694	2	A. Plastic type B was longest in length for both T1, 22 mm, and T2, 23mm. Plastic C had 14 mm in T1and 13mm in T2, and plastic D had 20 mm for both trial 1 and 2. So plastic B would be the atleast plastic for stretchability. ^p Two ways the experiment can be improved is if they included what type of plastic each was. And How much of a sample of plastic to measure, they all should be same length and width.
4695	2	In plastic A, the length went from 10mm, to 12mm in plastic B, the length went from 22mm, to 23mm in plastic C, the length went from 14mm, to 13 mm in plastic D, the length stood the same. ^p He/she should have added in the materials also explain it a little better.
4696	2	a. A stretched the most out of them all, and D stayed the same. ^p B. More trials, and they could of hang the plastic longer.
4697	2	Their data was successful. The students could of have more plastic types. They also could of had ammount stretched more data on it.
4698	2	The student could have not used same amount of weight as the 1st so he should have done that. Also he could have clamped and put the weights in different positions.
4699	2	Some of the plastic type have a little difference amount stretch. From T1 to T2 and some don't at all. One way the student could have improved the experiment is or determine the amount of weights use in experiment. Also it would or been better is  he perform a third trial.
4700	2	Based on the data table, type A was the lowest number and B was the highest. The student could've improved the experiment by maybe having a 3rd trial done. they could've also been more specific with the type of materials they used.(ex. durk tape, scotch tape, e.t.c)
4701	2	This experiment showed that adding weights to the plastic had very little effect on the plastic. These student could have told the amount of weight to add to the plastic in each trail. Also the lengh of plastic they used. A brand of plastic could have helped because of it qiulites.
4702	2	In this Experiment, plastic type B was able to support most weight, And plastic type A was able to support the least amount of weight. This student could have improved this doing maybe a couple more examples so we could compear more. Also, they could have done the experiment to see how weight each plastic could support before falling.
4703	2	If four different polymer plastics are streached to there maximum by weights than the mater at with the greatset amount of polymers will streach the most because, the length results will prove each ability to streach. This concludes the data results to show that plastic type B was tested and proven to hold the most stretch. The students experimental design could have been improved by either informing the experimentian exactly the constant length the plastic should be off the table or how materials.
4704	2	The students could have improved the experimental design by making a statement of how they improve, and was it difficult as if they had to do it more than 2 times.
4705	2	A.)Even though both times each plastic was tested the stretched about the same length. all of them either stayed the same of stretched an extra mm except for C which actually was smaller than the first trial. ^p B.)Two ways the could have improved are they could have counted how much weight it took to instead of stretching rip each plastic. A second improvement would be to trial each one more than twice, perhaps three to four times.
4706	2	After testing the four different plastics for stretchability the students found that plastic A stretched 2 mm longer, plastic C actually got 1 mm shorter, and plastic D stayed the same length. I conclude that plastic A has the most stretchability and plastic C has the least. In the experimental design the student should have told us how much weight was being put on the plastic, how far away term the edge we are to tape the plastic, what measurements we are to use to measure the plastic.
4707	2	-In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most it stretched to 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second. Plastic type A stretched the least 10mm. But in my second trial plastic type A stretched 12 (mm). But plastic type D didn't fall behind by much the
4708	2	A.) In this experiment only one object stretched out more after the second trial and that was plastic type  (A) and plastic type C didn't stretche more after the 2 trial. it stretched less. ^p B) he could of explained how many plastic samples he had. He could of the measure ment of plastic's before they were stretched to show the difference and how much it was stretched.
4709	2	a) What I have concluded was that plastic B was the most stretchable in both its trials. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment validity of the results was make each plastic the same measure in length to better compare it with one another and state what type of weight were used to stretch the plastic, grams, pounds, and so on.
4710	2	Plastic B B the most stretching at 22.5mm average stretch, followed by D, which stretched 20mm; then C at an average of 15.5mm. The least stretching plastic is A, having only stretched an average of 11mm. It can be concluded that (in descending order) the stretchiest B B, followed by D, then C, then A. ^P The experiment could be improved by cutting the plastic pieces to identical sizes to ensure strongest validity and utilize weights of equal mass so that all plastics experience the same downward force.
4711	2	a) Polymer A is the least stretched because the length of it at the end of the test was the shortest. ^P I specify how much weight is to be added to the clamp. ^P 2. Use a specific length of plastic at the beginning of each test.
4712	2	The student gathered very precise data, that this the student's result for each plastic were similar in trial one and two. This means he or she did not make any glaring errors in their experiment. However, two ways they could have improved their experimental design are to include the accepted stretching amount for each plastic (which would require some research) and to also include the measurement taken before the plastic were stretched in their data table.
4713	2	First the student should take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length. Second they should attach a clamp to the bottom edge of a plastic sample third they should tape the top of the plastic sample to a table so that its hanging freely down the side of the table. Four add weights and clamp allow them to hang for five minutes. Five remove the weight and clamp measure the length of a plastic types.^p B) Two ways the student could of improved the experiment was one, they should of explain there steps better second, put the plastic types in order.
4714	2	What I have noticed is as the structure tested the plastic type the amount stretch would increase and decrease each time. Two ways these students could have improved the experimential design would be doing another trial and adding more weights to the clamp.
4715	2	A.) Plastic type to would be best to use for strechabilty. ^p B.) They could've improved this experiment by using the same length of plastics. Also by getting the time of how long the plastics stretch for.
4716	2	a) The student's data reveals that plastic type B was the plastic that stretched the most. ^P b) The student could have improved the experimental design by including what material to use to measure the length of the plastic. The student could have also added to use the same weights for each plastic to make sure they are equally stretched.
4717	2	A conclusion the drawn is that plastic types A stretch the most and B stretch the second most, while D stretched the same and C stretched. The students could have improved their experiment by having three trial instead of this ones telling what type of plastic was use instead of A,B,C and D.
4718	2	After the experiment, plastic D was stretched out the most to 20mm in both trials. Also, in the experiment plastic A stretched the least in test 1 to 10 mm and in test 2 to 12 mm. ^p The student could have made his experiment better by having all the same plastics at the same length and say how much weights to put on the clamp. Also, to better his results he could do more trials and average the results to get accurate results.
4719	2	a) Based on the student's data, it is visible that not every plastic was the same length. Also, the student probably did not make sure that they ended at exactly five minutes, maybe five minutes and a few seconds. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results is by making sure each plastic is the same length so all the data is accurate. Also, to make sure there is the same amount of plastic hanging off the table.
4720	2	In conclusion plastic B was the strechiest because in both
4721	2	A) The students can conclude that they found out that some plastics stretch and others don't move. B) The students could of improved this by adding a lot more detail and probably added a hypothesis or they could of done a different method for stretching the plastic.
4722	2	a) Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic type D stretched the same a munt in trial one and two. b) The student could have improved their experiment by stating what amount of weight they were using and what type of plastics they were using, Also they should have performed  three trials.
4723	2	A. My conclusion from this student's data is that plastic B has the most stretchability; because it stretched 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2, which was the longest that any of the plastics were able to stretch. ^p b. This student could have improved their experimental design by telling us how much each weight that was the exp stretching the polymers. Should weigh to make the lab more accurate. Also, they should have included in the procedure that we were measuring in millimeters, to avoid any confusion, or inaccurate results.
4724	2	Plastic type B is the most rigid and flexible of the plastics. ^P One way the student could of made the experiment better is by seeing which plastic stretched to its way first. Another way the student could of improved is cut the plastic pieces to the same length.
4725	2	In conclusion plastic type A and B were stretched surprisingly type C stretch by a mm. Type D just stayed the same. ^P 1) Allowed the weights to hang for longer. ^P 2) Tested more plastics or heavier weight.
4726	2	a) You can conclude that the type of plastic used for trial one (T1) was less stretchable than the plastic used in the second trial. ^p b) The student could repeat their experiment. They could also have a constant in use the same type of plastic they used in each trial. They could also make sure to mention what instrument they used to measure the length of the plastic types.
4727	2	Each type of plastic either stayed the same or increased for 2 mm. This experiment can be inproved adding more weight let the weights hang on it longer than 5 minutes.
4728	2	Based on the data, polymer B stretched the farthest because it consistantly stretched more than any other polymer. ^p One way experimental design could be improved is to continue steps 6 and 7. A second way is to add a starting and ending length to the tables.
4729	2	They could have put more stronger type of plastic and put heavier or light weight on it.
4730	2	A) Conclusions plastic D is more affective the plastic A, B, C, D. Plastic B is also has a good stretchability as plastic as plastic plastic D best not as good. On the second trial. The stretchability of the plastic improved. On the second trial plastic D stayed the same, Plastic C decressed by one mm, plastic A+B increased by one mm. On both trials plastics A had a low stretchabilty. ^p B) Two ways the students could improve was by saying how much weight they were adding to the clamps, and only useing one type of weight , not weights.
4731	2	Plastic type B would have more stretchability than the others because the ammount stretched is 12 mm for the 1st trial but for the 2nd trial it 23 which pares that this polymer plastic can stretch at a good amount. The student could've made a more reasonable design that had less confusion & would explain it better.
4732	2	The conclusion is some bags sretch more than others. One thing he could have improved on was being specific on how much weight he put on each bag. He could of also added weight for the second trail.
4733	2	I conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was type B. I said type B stretched the most because for both trials type B had the larger numbers. In trial 1 it was 22mm and in trial 2 it was 23mm. The student could of improved the experiment by having the length of the plastic initially recorded so that you could compare them and also make sure for the 2nd trial that the starting length was the same length.
4734	2	In conclusion, plastic type be was the strongest because in T1it held 22 weights. T2 it held 23 weights. Plastic A was the weakest plastic because in T1 it only held 10 weights. T2 it held only12, so plastic B would be the best plastic. ^P The student could of done a third trial see if results get higher. Hang the clamp for about 3 minutes the propally could of got higher results.
4735	2	The plastics that were chosen for the experiment dont stretch very much and if they kept the weights on the plastic for more than 5 minutes then the outcome may have come differently. Another improvement woudl be to add a hevier weight  and see how long it takes for the students to stretch and how long it stretches.
4736	2	In this experiment, you are able to conclude that the plastic type A stretched the least which means that it is the most durable plastic out of the four. We should use plastic A because it is least likely to break. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is having a third trial to help them out. Also to have a control group.
4737	2	What I got in conclusion is that plastic type B got stretched out more than the others to improve this experimental design was using more details like how much were the weights.
4738	2	From this experiment I conclude that plastic B is the streatchiest because it had a streatch of 22/23. Plastic D had 20/20 and the others were 11 in tens, Two ways the students ca improve design is by testing a third time to make sure there was no mistakes and let the weight hang longer because it could be that one of the plastics takes longer to start streatching.
4739	2	A)Based on the information , plastic type B is the strongest and plastic type A is the weakest.^p (B)Two ways the experimental design could be improved is to tell us the exact type of plastics and how much did the weights (attached to clamp) weigh.
4740	2	The two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design or validity is to dirde or mutiblie 10 and 12 of A.
4741	2	a.) A conclusion for the students data is when using the polymer plastic type D. it stretched the same amount of 50mm. Also that type B seemed to be the best plastic because both times it was able to stretch the longest. ^p b.) Two ways this experiment could have been better is if the plastics were all  starting at the same time and if the first time before the weights went on the student measured the starting length of different plastics.
4742	2	The students could have wrote down which plastic they though was going to stretch the most. And also they should of wrote down the different plastic names.
4743	2	a) Based on the data, in both trials, plastic type B was to stretchiest polymer plastic. ^p b.) In order to improve this experiment, the students should have more trials and they could use various sizes of weights.
4744	2	a) My conclusion based om the student's data to plastic type B and D stretched the most. For trail 1, B had 22 mm and D had 20mm for trail 2, B had 23 mm abd D had 20 mm again. ^p b) One way the student could improve the experimental design or validity of results is in the data table, add how many mm the plastics were before the experiment to see how much they stretched over 5 mins, The second way is in the data table. Put in a column on how much weight they used during the experiment, that way we can see how much weight it takes to stretch the polymer plastics.
4745	2	The results how that all plastics A through D stretched out after the weights were added. However, there were some that stretched out more than others like plastic B. To improve the experimental design or validity the students could have mentioned in the procedure and used the same length of plastic for all types and trials. Also they could have kept the amounts of weight constant through out the experiment.
4746	2	In the data it is concluded that plastic type B has the most stretchability testing at 22 and 23mm. The data also shows plastic type A has the least stretchability with testing at 10 and 12 mm. The students could have improved the experiments design by leting more clear on the shape and size of the plastic before the weights were added. They could also foctor in the weight of the clumps.
4747	2	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest while plastic type A is the least stretchy. ^p b) The student could have done more trials. The student could have also let the plastics hang for a greater time to more accurately test their stretchability.
4748	2	a. Plastic C is the most stretchable. I stretched an average of 22.5mm while the other 3 plastics stretched 11mm, 13.5mm, and 20mm. ^p The student should have attached the plastic to the table with stretching more secure than tape. Also, they should specify the amount of weight they added to the bottom of the plastic and they should make it the same for every trial to their data accurate.
4749	2	(A) The students data showed that, an average, plastic type B was the most stretchy. ^P (B) The student could have improved by 1) Doing more trials  2) Holding the clamp on the plastic longer.
4750	2	In conclusion, plastics type A the first time stretched 10mm the second time it stretched 12mm. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, second time 23mm. The plastic type B was the most stRetched. But plastic type D was 20mm and the second time 20mm. D was close to plastic B.
4751	2	Plastic B had the most stretchability in both trials with 22mm in trial A and 23 mm in trial B. Plastic A had the least with 10mm in trial A and 12mm in trial B. ^p One improvement is adding a third trial because they only had two trials and another requirement is taking the average of each plastic for comparison.
4752	2	a) In conclusion, plastics B and D are the more stretchable plastics compared to C and A which are less stretchable. B being the most, while A being the least. ^p b) The student could have improved the experiment design by making sure each plastic had equal length and mass also by adding equal amount of weight on a specific area of each plastic.
4753	2	A conclusion based on the data is plastic type A stretches the least (T1-10, T2-12). Plastic type B stretched the most (T1 20, T2-20) Therefore plastic type D has best stretch ability. 2 ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to use different because of plastic to see which brand is better and to say how many wieghts they are putting on the clamp.
4754	2	A) In the experiment, plastic ''B'' stretched the farthest at an avg of 22.5mm.^p B) One way to improve the experiment would be to have a controlled or set length for the plastics instead of just saying any length which can give invalid results. Next, I would improve the experimental design by controlling the # of weights used as well as keeping the weights as constant.
4755	2	a)From looking at the data, I can see that plastic B stretched the most in both trials, and plastic A stretched the least in both trials.^p (b)One way they could have improved their experimental design would be to may be do a third trial to see if you get the same thing they could  do is let the plastics hang for longer.
4756	2	A) In conclusion most of the plastics streched or stayed the same in the second trial. ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have been improved was to add more than two trials to each and to test less plastics.
4757	2	A: My conclusion, based on these results, is that plastic type B is the strongest.B) To make their results vald, they should've done more trials and possibly averaged it out. Plus,a control would give them something to compare their results to so they're more accurate.
4758	2	a) From the data, I've concluded that plastic type B had stretched the most (22 and 23mm). Plastic type D stretched the same both times (20mm), plastic type C stretched 1mm farther the first trial (14 and 13 mm) and plastic type A stretched 2mm farther the second trial (10 and 12mm). ^p b) The student could have improved this experiment by showing the original lengths of the plastics in their data and specifying how much the weights weighed and what the different plastic types were.
4759	2	In conclusion the types of plastic for T2 had better results than T1. Two ways the students could  have improved the experiment is by writting  out the types of plastic, and to put an equal amount of weight for each plastic,
4760	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B was the one that stretched the most after 5 minutes. As can be seen in the data table. It stretched 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The only one that even reached 20 mm in any of the two trials was plastic type D. Two ways that the students could have improved this experiment is by telling them how many times to cut the plastic if it wasn't the same size as the others so that there would not be different size plastics. Also, the student could have said what types of weights and how much each weight weighed in the procedure so that the reader knows what kinds of weights should be used.
4761	2	a) In trial one sample A stretched to 10 (mm), sample B stretched to 22mm, sample C stretched to 14mm and sample D stretched to 12mm. Sample B stretched to 23mm, Sample C stretched to 13mm and D stretched to 20mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design is they could have recorded their data and they could've tried each trial carefully.
4762	2	A) Based on the results, plastic B was the strechyest plastic. Triol one it stretched to 22 millimeters and in trial 2 it stretched to 23 millimeters. ^p B) This experiment could have been improved by adding more waits ton the plastic to see if it might have been able to stretch further. Another way is to add another trial to get very accurate results.
4763	2	Plastic A+ B both gained a length plastic C lost a lenght and plastic D stayed the same length. They could have done more tests with the plastics and used more plastics.
4764	2	The more the weight the less the rubber band stretched. The student could have given better information. Also the student could have given more instructions for the lab.
4765	2	In conclusion to this students investigation, plastic B could hold more weight for 5 minutes and stretched the longest in millimeters for both trials. Also plastic A had the lowest results throughout the experiment. To give this project a better score, the student could have labeled what kinds of plastic he used. The student could have written how much weight he put on each type of plastic to give this realism.
4766	2	The conclusion is that Plastic Type B stretchability is the greatest where as Plastic Type A's strechability is the least. ^p They could have improved the expiroment by adding the same amount of weights by each plastic and make sure that each plastic is taped at the same length on the table so that the tape or weights would not affect the stretchability.
4767	2	"In conclusion based on data that the numbers didn't make so much up or down (it's were very close) but T2 was more accuret. It showed that numbers were up except plastic type ""D"". ^p One way they could have improved the design by eliminating # 6: don't need it these second they could had improved is by being more specific about number ""4"" like how much lengths."
4768	2	a) In conclusion we can see that plastic type B is more stretch able compared toother types. In the two trials1 &2 had 22 and 23 mm which is newest. ^p b) One way they could of improved the experiment is to do same more trials. Another why to improd the experiment is to specifcly tell us how much weight on the end of the plastic
4769	2	The conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that some of they plastics tested weigh more than others and some after being stretched more then are don't weigh as much. ^p Two ways the students could have improved there experiment would be to perform more than just to trails so they could have compared the data. Another way they could have improved would be to try more than just four types of polymer plastics.
4770	2	a) Plastic type B has the stretchiest polymer type. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity of the results by adding one more extra trial, and keeping the heavyness of the weights constant.
4771	2	In conclusion,plastic type B stretched the longest in 5 minutes with 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.The plastic that stretched the least with 10 and 12mm is A. One way to improve the experimental design is to hang a set amount of weight from the plastic, by not doing this you don't know which plastic is most durable. Also you could be more careful where exactly you place the clamp, placing it to high enables the plastic to fully stretch.
4772	2	a) Polymer B had the longest increase in length with polymer A having the shortest gain. ^p b) He could graph the amount stretched by weight. ^p He could also perform more trials to get more accurate results.
4773	2	A.Plastic type B stretched farther than plastic type A, C and D. It stretched 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial 2 ^p B.One way the students could have improved their experiment would be to add different types of weights (small/big). Also they could measure how for each plastic stretches every 5 minutes and see which one lasts longer.
4774	2	a) The flexibility of the plastics from most to least is: B, D, C, A. B and D are probably made of branched polymers, A made of criss-linked polymers and C of either linear or cross-linked. ^p b) The student should have recorded the amount each plastic stretched with different weights hanging from them. She could have also put the weights back on after the first five minutes and observe how it continues to stretch, recording data at several time intervals.
4775	2	"A- The conclusion that can be drawn based off of the student's data is, ""plastic type B"" , is the stretchiest out of the other plastic types. ^p B- The two ways the student could have improved this experimental design/validity of his results is by measuring exactly the same lengths for all plastics so plastic stars off longer than the other. Secondly that could record how heavy enough weight is and how many they have added to the clamp."
4776	2	In the conclusion plastic type B stretched the most at of all the plastics. Plastics type B stretched 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial 2. Plastic type A was the least stretchy because in trail in stretched 10mm and trail 2 12mm. The students can improve their validity by telling what the starting length was. Also they should of said how much weight to add.
4777	2	At the end of the polymer investigation type A stretched the most, starting with 10 mm and stretching to 12 mm. Type d didn't stretch at all and type C actually got shorter, starting at 14mm and ending with 13mm. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by starting off with all the same length of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is by adding in the procedure how much weight to hang on the clamp.
4778	2	Based on the students data I was able to com to a conclusion & see that plastic types A through C, were able to streach & decrease from both trials. now plastic type D wasn't it remain the same limit in trial 2 as it reacted in trial 1.
4779	2	My conclusion based on the students data is plastic B's stretchability is more greater than the other plastics tasted. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is they could have two prop's stretch the plastic and measure at to see how long it stretched. They could have also added more weight to the clamps.
4780	2	"a). The conclusion I would draw based on the student's data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the longest than any other plastic. Plastic type C stretched 14mm and then the second trial is decreased by 1 mm. Plastic type D stretched 20mm and for trial 2 it stayed the same. Plastic type A stretched 10 mm and increased by 2 mm. ^p B.) The two ways the students could have improve the experimental design is that be more precise will there procedure and name the plastic type. Also, tell us what to use to measure the length."
4781	2	According to the data I have collected the plastic that stretched the most was plastic B. Plastic B went from 22mm in the first trial to 23mm in the second trial. Plastic C really cought my attention however because it went from 14mm in the first trials to 13mm in the second meaning it shrunk. Some validity issues were that they didn't tell you what kind of plastic they used instead they labled it with letters. Another validity issue is that the group didn't give the first measurement of the plastic so you could see the change in the first trial.
4782	2	I think it was a lab that wat they were doing.
4783	2	After the polymer investigation, I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest polymer considering stretchability. This is because of the four plastics tested, A was the least permanently stretched and underwent the least plastic deformation. This, it is the most elastic polymer and B (with quite opposite results) the least elastic (stretchable). This experiment could've been made better by recording the initial length of each plastic in the data table and by including the average amount stretched of each plastic to improve validity.
4784	2	"Based on the data, plastic type ""B"" is the most durable, meaning that it has the most stretchability. In trial 1 B stretches 22 (mm). In trial 2 it stretches 23 (mm). The students could have improved the experiment design & also the validity"
4785	2	a) According to the data, plastic type B could stretch the farthest and plastic type A could stretch the least far. ^p b) One way to improve the experiment would be to add the weights to the clamps at time instruments rather than add randomly in a time period as 5 mins. For example, the first weight would get put on once the timer started and after an seconds another weight would be added, and this process would continue. This would help the validity of the experiment because it is to going the highest as a controlled result. Another way to improve this experiment would be to keep length of each plastic type constant. This would keep the length as a controlled variable and thus improve the validity of the experiment.
4786	2	a) In conclusion, in both trials plastic type A was stretched the least and plastic type B was stretched the most ^p One way they could have improved their experiment, they could have added more trials. Another way is that they could have described the weights a little more in step 4 so their experiment can be repeated as similar as possible.
4787	2	Plastic type A is the least flexible while plastic type B was the most flexible plastic. The students could have added different weights that may have been heavier or lighter. They also could have recorded the weights of the plastic.
4788	2	From the students results I can tell that plastic type B is strongest material and plastic type A is the weakest. The students could have done one or two more test to further improve reliability of thier results and he/she could have also written down the amounts of weights put on each type of plastic that caused it to break.
4789	2	A. Based on the recorded data of the polymer investigation experiment I come to the conclusion that that type B polymer plastic had greatest amount of stretchability because after all four of the sample polymers were tested under exact same conditions and sample B stretched the furthest length, a length of 45 cm. ^p B. In step 5 he should state that the weight must be identical as to ensure all plastics are tested in an identical manner. They should also state in step one that plastics must be the same lengh. If the plastics are shorter they will actually be stronger due to leverage, and that would affect validity.
4790	2	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B can be stretched the furthes . The students could've improved his experiment by adding more trials and finding an average.
4791	2	Based on the students data from trial 1 and 2, it has been proven that polymer/plastic B can withstand being stretched the bigest. In both trials, plastic B was superior to the others by holding 22 and 23 mm in wright. These students could improve their validity and design by adding key information to the procedure. For example in step 1 by giving the exact dimentions of the plastic being cut can allow all the trials to follow to be constant. Another way to improve you experiment, is to let the reader in step 5 if you add the weights one at a time or all at once and then let 5mm pass.
4792	2	a)Based on the students data plastic A in trial 1 had 10mm & went up to 12mm in T2. Plastic B trial 1 had 22 e went up to just 23 in T2. Plastic C had  14mm in trial1 & went down one to 13mm in T2.Plastic D stayed the same for T1& T2.^p b) The students should of tried another trial and they should of also had another different type of plastic.
4793	2	A) In our conclusion type B plastic work the best. It had the most stretchability in both trials.^p B) They could of made a graph for the experiment to make it easier to mearstarve.
4794	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was the the polymer because it stretched the largest. One way the students could have improved their experiment was to write down how much each weight weighed for. Also, they could of left the weights on the polymers a little longer.
4795	2	a)The student improved their experiment every time.
4796	2	In trial 2 polymer bags stretched the most than other bags. ^p The students could have completed more trials. They could of been more specific with the type of weight.
4797	2	My conclusion, based on the data provided is, plastic type A had the best durability because it didn't stretch as much as the other did. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by adding more trials to the process and to give brand names of the plastics.
4798	2	a) Plastics A and B stretched farther the second time, but plastic C stretched less. Plastic D stretched the same distance for both trials. Plastic D stretched the furthest out of all the plastics. Plastic D is the stretchiest out of all the plastics and plastic A is the least stretchy. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by adding the same amount of weight to all of the plastics. They could have also done another trial (B) to make sure their results were valid.
4799	2	NSR
4800	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of plastic with T1 stretching 22mm and T2 stretching 23mm. Temperature the validity of the experiment the students could have tested the plastics with more or less weights attatched. They also could have mentioned the stretch over more or less time.
4801	2	A. Plastic B was able to strech the most. ^p B. More trials more types of plastic.
4802	2	3. Breed on the student's data, the amount stretched (mm) 12 has more than 12. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experiment could be use the same amount of weight put with different types of objects or whatever they used.
4803	2	At the end of the polymer Investigation the students data concludes that plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic measured. One way this experiment's design of results could've been improved would have been to check the thickness of the different plastics because that would effect how for they stretch. Another way this experiment could've been improved would be to check the date at which the plastics were manufactured because after time and different environments some materials may be in better or worse condition which would affect its strength and stretchability.
4804	2	A) I conclude that polymers B stretched the farthest trial 1 and 2. Also that polymers A stretched the least farthest out of all the polymers. ^p B) There are many ways the students could have improved their experiment. For example they could have listed the polymers they used. Also they could have done more trials.
4805	2	Conclusion based on the data found in trial 2, plastic type B was stretched the furthest and plastic type A was not as flexible as type B. ^p One way the student could have better described the procedure was say how much the waits weighed. And the student could have added more trials to get better validity in the data.
4806	2	In conclusion the students investigated four different polymer plastics for stretchability. Plastic A in trial 1 stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 12mm. Plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm. Plastic C in trial 1 stretched 14mm and in trial 2 it stretched 15mm, and finally   plastic D stretched 20mm in trial 1 and in trial 2 it stretched 20mm. The two ways that the students can improve is add a control and more trials.
4807	2	I conclude that plastic type A is the best plastic because it stretched the least of all the plastics. This shows that it is the strongest because with the same weight, this one was capable of balaing them the easiest. One way they could improve their experimental design is by making sure all of the sample basis were the same length. This is so we know the outcome isn't changed by the different sizes. They also should have said the exact weight of the weights so the expirement could be replicated.
4808	2	a. During trial 2 the results were about the same and the plastic containers stretched further then the first trial.^p The way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing the experiment over again Also, the student could have used more plastic samples for this experiment.
4809	2	a. Plastic type B had the most stretchability, stretching 22mm on the 1st trial and 23mm on the 2nd trial. Plastic type D had the second most stretching power followed by C and then A.^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results would be to conduct 2 more trials for better validity and they should mention the amount of weight in each bag.
4810	2	This experiment is useful in many ways and it is also a good way to see which plastic was the least strechable and which one was the most strechable. One way to improve this experiment is by saying the number of weights that should be put on. Another way is that it should say much each weight has to weigh.
4811	2	A) For the most part in T2 the plastic type are the same length or longer. ^p B.) One way, the student could have improved the experimental design is by add about 5 more mins to the second trial so see more of a length difference. For the results the students should made a graph to see the results better.
4812	2	To conclude plastic A is the best for stretching, for example plastic A stretch to 2(mm) while plastic B,C stretched to 1(mm) and plastic D didn't stretched.^p They could improve their experiment by adding more trials and adding the same amount of weight to each type of bags.
4813	2	A) Based on the data, I would say that the test was not as valid as it could be.^p B) To make it more valid, they could have said to get plastic samples of all the same size because a bigger peice might hold weight better.
4814	2	Conclusion-A student conducted this experiment in order to find out which of the four polymer plastics can stretch the longest, (A, B, C, D). Looking at the data table it shows that polymer plastic B stretched out the longest with a measurement of 22.7 mm on T1 and a measurement of 23mm on T2. This student could've improved the experimental design by being more specific in step 1. By adding how long the sample was suppose to be. Also for step 4 by adding how much weight is needed for this experiment.
4815	2	a. By the students hanging the plastic sample down the side of the table, putting a clamp on it, and adding weights to it, made the plastic stretch for A and B. For C, the stretching went down 1mm and for D it stayed at 20mm. ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to add a third trial so we could see if the plastic would stretch more. Also they could have said how much the weights weighed because that could make a difference.
4816	2	My conclusion from the student's experiment is that plastic type D is the strongest because in both trials shown it was stretched the longest.two ways they could have improved the experiment  are they could have improved the experiment are they could have done more trials for accuracy and they could have included the different types of plastics used (grocery bag, sandwich bag, plastic wrap, garbage bag, etc).
4817	2	They should do alot of trial on there experiment. I think that the plasic type stretched the most out of all of them.
4818	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable of the four plastics. In both trials, it stretched the least, meaning that the polymer stretchability is not the great. On the other hand, plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched out the most compared to the other three. If I were to carry a large package, I would use polymer B because it will not break and it stretches the farthest. Two ways the students could have improved the validity of the results would be to write down the measurements of each plastic with no weights and to conduct more trials. By doing this you are showing the comparison between before and after, and by doing more trials you are making your data more accurate and valid.
4819	2	One conclusion that can draw based on the data is the reacting the per-data, plastic type B was stretched the longest amount of milimeters. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by adding more trials, so if can they would do more data to support a by potentials. Another way this experiment could be improved is making sure that all of the plastic samples are the same length and weight because they could also add or take away from the stretches or some trials.
4820	2	A) They put a peice of tape of the the end of the table the part that was hanging they added weights the proceded this procedure twice and come up with (cook below) T2 succeded.^p B)They could have tested 2 different weight numbers or they could of test the point of how long the tape wuz and how long it ended up at the end with weights.
4821	2	A. Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 23mm. While the second close plastic, which is D, only stretch 20mm. ^p B. The student couldve had more trials, also a control to improve the experiment.
4822	2	a) Conclusion type B is the most weakest type C is 2nd strongest, type A is the strongest. ^p b) They could have cut down on the time  5 minutes is a little to much 3 minutes would be good and they should have done more trials 3-4.
4823	2	The purpose of the lab was to test four different polymers plastic for stretchability. In conclusion plastic B did indeed held the most weight. In trial 1 an trial 2. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm. The weakest plastic was plastic A which in trial 1 only stretched 10mm and trial 2 only stretched 12mm. Plastic C was 2nd strongest stretching 14mm in trial 1and 13 in trial 2. While plastic D was the 2nd strongest stretching 20mm in the 1st and 2nd trial. Two ways the student could've improved the experimental design are he could've had longer time period to hold the weights and he could've more than 2 trials.
4824	2	a) Based on the trial from the student
4825	2	a) Plastic type B stretches the most while type A stretches the least. ^P b) The student should have used the same amount of weights for each one. The length of plastic one should be the same. The amount of tape used should be the same (constant) could had a control group.
4826	2	In conclusion, if you test four different polymer plastic for stretchability plastic type B stretched an average of 22.5mm ,while plastic type A stretched an average of plastic type was 13.5mm and plastic type D was 20 mm.One way the student could improved the experimental design are more accurate. Also the student should have included ,measurement in their procedure we know the plastic starting length and the amount of weight added.
4827	2	A. The students have concluded that plastic sample B is the most durable with 22 and 23mm in both trials. The least durable plastic sample would be plastic sample A, because it only got 10 and 12mm between both trials. ^p B. Two ways that the students could have improve their experiment would be to specify the amount of weight they are adding in the clamps. Finally, the students should perform more trials so they have the best results.
4828	2	In results plastic Type B 23 has stretched the farthest, Type D 20 stretched the second farthest, Type C 13 stretched the third farthest, and Type A 12 stretched the smallest. In conclusion plastic Type B length was the most 22 T1 and 23 T2.
4829	2	A) Based on my data chart, I found that plastic sample B streches out the most out of the four plastics I sampled.
4830	2	1. The students should make a different data table and not the same so the experiment could show that is showing a different way of the procedure.^p 2. I think that the steps of the procedure should include more details and have a closing conclusion to show how the experimental group had ended.
4831	2	Based on the student's data, I am able to conclude that plastic type B stretched the most out of all the types and therefore is the most stretchable. One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be to test different amounts of time being stretched. Another way would be to do an additional trial so it would be 3 instead of 2 increase the validity of the results.
4832	2	Plastic type B statched the most using this experiment. One way to improve the results would be to do another trial because the inconsistent results could be settled by a third trial. Another thing to improve the experiment would be to have equal mm length of plastic and then have the weight /clamp stretched because that could have an effect such as the sensed weight pulling down so all sure length of something like 20mm.
4833	2	a. A student performed the following investigation to test four differen polymer plastic for stretchability. In conclusion type B stretched the longest length. ^p b. Two way the could improve the experimental design is by telling what brand the plastic is and by telling how much the mass of weights and keep constant and more trials.
4834	2	(a) After this experiment, the data shows that in both trials, plastic type B was the plastic that had the most amount stretchability. The chart shows that plastic B stretched 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. This was the most length any of the four plastics streched. So plastic B would've be most stretchable. (b) However this experiment could be improved. First of all he could have been specific by stating in his procedure how much the weights was, and how many. For example, recorded how much the plastic would stretch before it broke. Secondly, the students should have stated in the data original length, and the length it was affecting weights.
4835	2	base on the students data I can conclude that most accurate plastic type was D the amount stretched 2o for T1 and T2 (mm). ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is that they should have done 3 trials so it can be more reliable and they could have drawn a graph to have more validity.
4836	2	A. In conclusion, plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic for the trials. Plastic B stretched 22mm for trial 1 and 23mm for trial 2 while plastic A stretched only 10mm for trial 1, and 12 mm for trial 2. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design could be (1) in the procedure to tell how much tape to use to hold down the plastic, and (2) to tell us if you are supposed to use the same pieces of plastic for trial 2, or a different piece.
4837	2	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic Type stretch the most according to the two trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design was to provide The beginnins length before The plastic is stretched because it is important to see in comparison to no beginning length how much it stretched. One way The student could have improved the validity of the results was to conduct a third trial because plastic A, B, C all had different stretch amounts in millimeters from trial 1 to trial 2
4838	2	According to the results of the lab, plastic type B stretched the most, stretching 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial two. Plastic type A is the most durable, stretching the least, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial one and 10mm on trial two.^p The design of the experiment could be improved if more types of plastic were used in the experiment.^p The validity of the experiment could be improved if the students specified the exact types of bags they used in the experiment, ''Glad sandwhich Bay''.
4839	2	a) Polymer A is more durable because it streched the least on the 2 trials.^p b) The students should do more than 2 trials. They should also measure the amm. of weight they're putting on the plastic as it was not specified.
4840	2	When processing through this experiment most plastics at the end showed improvement. Plastic type D was the only one that didn't change its length. In the second trial plastic (C) went down from 14mm to 13mm. And plastics (A&B) raised up two measurements. This experiment can be recapable but it wouldn't turn out as the same measurements. They students could of explained correctly what you had to repeat, and do with the other three plastics. And atleast name the plastic to give you more understandance, and knowledge to improve their design.
4841	2	Based on the student's data, polymer plastic A has the highest tensile strength, with an average of only 11mm stretched. The next closest (and strongest) is polymer C, with an average of 13.5mm stretched. D is the weakest than those two, with 20mm stretched and the weakest polymer plastic is B with 22.5mm stretched on average. One way this experiment could have been improved is to specify how heavy the weights were (constant). Also to increase validity the student could have had all the polymer plastics stare this experiment as all the same length and width maybe this would affect the abilituy to stretch.
4842	2	The conclusion I reached using the student's data is that plastic B stretched the most 22 to 23 milimeters while plastic a stretched the least, at only 10 $ 12 mm. One way they could have improved their experiment would be to specify how trenny the weights should be and how long each piece of plastic should be. The second thing  they could have done was conduct a third trial to make sure their data is valid.
4843	2	Based on the student's data, polymer B its the weakest polymer because it stretched the most. One way the student could improve this experiment is by having more trials. More trials will give the student more valid data. Another way the student can improve this experiment is by testing the strength of the polymer: with different amounts of weight. Having heavier or lighter weights could tell the student exactly how much weight the polymer can withstand before it breaks.
4844	2	a) The stretchiest type of plastic is B. The least strechiest type of plastic is type A. b) The student could've heated the plastic pieces a little bit call to the same temperature so that his observations would have been more noticeable. He would also want to make sure that in the beginning, all the pieces of plastic had the same length and thickness.
4845	2	Two way their investigations would improve is by adding the control & the weights.
4846	2	Plastic type D is the strongest. They could have told us the conclusion. They could have also made the data table easyer the read.
4847	2	A. The conclusion would be that even though they stretched some look to short. But impressed because B and D plastic types stretched a lot. ^p B. The student could have improved by using more weights or heavier weights. Instead of using the table as the base, the student could have done it in a totally different way like using his hand or hanging it from the window or roof.
4848	2	At the end the students can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most. Also two ways the students could have improved their experiment results is by adding a third trial and by making sure the same pressure being put to stretch each plastic is used each time.
4849	2	A) I conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability due to the fact that it has higher numbers on both trials. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experimental design is by trying different types of plastic to see the stretchability compared to each other. Another way they could have improved it is by telling us the amount of time they stretched the plastic for.
4850	2	A. The students may have had a few errors between trials to get such different results except for D). ^p B. The students could have said how much of the plastic should be taped down because otherwise the differing of plastic taped down can change the trial length. They should have used something different than a clamp because the clamp could potentially break off a piece of plastic.
4851	2	a.) My conclusion is that plastic type B has more stretchability than the other plastic types because, in both Trials plastic type B had more stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b.) The students could have improved their experiment by performing 3 trials instead of 2. They also could of did a line graph instead of a two table so that people could get a better idea of how much the plastic types stretch.
4852	2	Plastic type B stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by adding more trials, and by giving the names of the plastics.
4853	2	Based on the students data, it can be concluded that, in order from most stretchy to least, it would be: Type B,D,C, then A. Type B had a higher stretch average of 22.5m, while A had a low avg. at 11. They could have improved validity by measuring the over intervals of line, for example, they could have it every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. And they could have improved the experiment by using the same length for  plastic A, B,C,D. Instead of just measuring the  sample.
4854	2	a) plastic type B was the the most stretchable, stretching 22-23 mm. Plastic A was the least stretchable, only reaching 10-12mm when stretched. ^p b) The student should have measured the lengths of the plastics and not them. In the same length so the people following it won't have to have more measurements and confusion. Next the student should have added the same amount of weights and same measurement of weights to each clamp because 20g would stretch plastic less than 20g, so the datas might not be reliable.
4855	2	The second trik t2, stretched move than T1. ^p The student didn't tell us what kind of plastic to use. They didn't say how much to put on
4856	2	a) A conclusion I can draw based on the a data is that in the second trial it didn't stretch that much father than the first trial. ^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved is if they used different types of plastic and measured which are stretched the most. Another way is they should have added the same amount of weights.
4857	2	By adding weights to a plastic cup with a clamp under for a certain time they found a measurement of the plastics. ^p To improve the experiment they could have determined what kind of plastic. They also could have let it hang for a longer time.
4858	2	A conclusion that coud be drawn from the data is that plastic type A had the best results and there stretched the most, in both trials. Two ways the student could improve the experiment, is by repeating the steps again and having a 3rd trial for better accuracy, and then even add in another plastic type to really see which kind stretches better.
4859	2	Based on the student's table, I'd conclude that plastic A is the least stretchiest. It only stretched to be 10mm the first trial and 12mm the second trial. Also, that plastic B is the stretchiest seeing that is stretched to 22mm T1 and 23mm T2. The student could have improved his /her experiment by setting a specific length to start with for each plastic to allow readers to see the difference. Also, the student should specify how much weight to add and the weight of the clamp.
4860	2	The conclusion of the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. It's first trial it stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type A didn't stretched the most. It only stretched 10mm on its first trial and 12mm on it's second trial. ^p Two ways the students could of improved their experimental design would be to do a third trial and have the clamp attached to the plastic for 10 minutes instead of the 5 minutes.
4861	2	a. Although certain plastics are different, you can only strech them so far. Also with streching the same type of plastic twice. The measurement is not gonna change drastinally. ^p Be you could add another trial to create a more accurate data form. Also you could lengthen or shorten the amount of time you are streching the plastic.
4862	2	The students data shows that the most stretchable plastic is plastic type B. Two ways that the experiment could have been improved is to do it again. Also, the students should have made sure all of the plastics were the same length before experimenting on it.
4863	2	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the furthest and plastic type A stretches the least furthest. The student could have improved the experimental design by doing more trials of each, and then finding an average. She also could have made things more constant and specify by stating trials 3 as the amount of plastic used to be held down to the table, or how heavy the weights were.
4864	2	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experimental design of the validity of the results by doing more trials and by adding another control.
4865	2	* The conclusion to that the type A plastic stretched more than the others because stretch 2 more mm than the other ones.
4866	2	"A) Plastic ""D"" stretched the furthest. ^P B) The student should have included the starting length and width. These both should be held constant. Also, for each trial, the student should make one trial have a weight of 20. This gives the experiment range for more variability and accuracy."
4867	2	A- Based on the data, the plastic type B streches the most.^p B-1) They should have said to make all plastics same length^p 2) Should have specified the amount of weight.
4868	2	a.) Plastic type D had the greatest stretchability. ^p b.) To improve the experiment design and/or the validity of the results of this experiment the students could have added more constant variables. Constant variable ensure that your data is valid by improving your experimental design with the same procedures. Also, a control could be added. A control allows students to compare their data to the normal/ standards independent variable only. These factors improve an experiment.
4869	2	a) After performing the experiment the students could conclude that sample B was the most stretchable reaching 22mm on the first try and 23 on the second, and that sample A was the least stretchable reaching 10mm and 12mm.^p  b) They could have explained what kind of weights to use,  and they should measure it while its hanging so they know for sure how long it can stretch
4870	2	B.Use the same but not used polymer plastics because the ones that were used already were being tested during the experiment, and they used them again for the second trial, so use the same but new polymer plastics.^p Also to add the same amount of weights for the plastic, and to do another trial with more weight.
4871	2	My conclusion to this student's data would be that plastic B had the most stretchability. One thing I would change in the experimental plan would be that I would of used only one type of weights (brand & 1bs) to use as my constant control the their thing I would change is I would let T2 sit for 10min and see if there is more of a change in data.
4872	2	Based on the data plastic type stretched the most, it stretched to 11mm as the first trial 11mm on the second trial plastic type B stretched the second most. ^p b. State how much weight could have a stretch used and the plastics are being used.
4873	2	Each plastic type stretches more than the previous one. Type A and C seemed to be the strongest because they only stretched 10 and 14 inches while B and D stretched 22 and 20 inches. Two ways the student could have improved the expirement are to have a third trial and be specific on how much weight the student added.
4874	2	The conclusion based on the data is that plastic type B, has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest, while D was the second most, C was the third most and A was the least stretchable. The first way this experiment could be improved is if each type of plastic had the same specific starting length, so that one length didn't stretch easier than another. Also the weights added to the clamp should be identified specifically so the experiment can be repeated.
4875	2	The students could have performed more trials.^p The students could have used more than one plastic.
4876	2	a. The students can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A is the least stretchable. Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b. One way the students can improve their experiment is by stating the amount of weights in pounds in step 8. It is important to know how much weight is being added. A second way to improve the experiment is by doing additional trials with heavier weights in order to see how much the plastics can stretch.
4877	2	A) Based on the results, I've concluded that plastic B can be stretched the most. ^p B) One way to improve the validity of the results is to make sure the starting length for all four polymers are the same. The second way to improve the validity is to use the same amount of weights for all four polymers.
4878	2	I can conclude that plastic type B has stated the most because. Two way the students can improve their experimental is to name plastics and have constants in their experiment.
4879	2	A) It seems that the results make sense. Plastic B & D were clearly the most flexible and the others were not. B was the most flexible altogether. ^P B) He could have had a control to base the experiment off of. he could try different amounts of weights on the plastics.
4880	2	(A) After trying out all the polymer plastics twice, first trial the highest it a stretched was 22 while the second trial was different the highest it stretched was 23. They were both pastic type B.  It seem like it stretched more on trial 2 but also less and equals for the others type of plastic. ^p (B) one way they could or improve was to do 2 third trial. ^p Second way explain how much weights do we need to use.
4881	2	How does T2 affects T1. My conclusion plastic B has more stretchability then the others.
4882	2	From looking at the results of the polymer investigation lab I conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, in both trials it stretched the most out of all the other plastics. ^p One way the experiment could be improved if at the beginning of trial, all the plastics are cut at the same length. If they start off being the same length comparing the results would be easier and more accurate. Another way to improve the lab is to use something stronger than tape to hold the plastic. With tape the plastic a/ the weights most likely even fall.
4883	2	Based on the student's data. I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. I can conclude this because in both trial 1 and 2 the plastic stretched more than the others. The student's could have improved the experimental design. One way is they could have added more trials. Another way is they could of said the type of plastic they were using. This is how they could of improved their experimental design.
4884	2	They should of named the different type of plastic and could of double check there measurements.
4885	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B was able to be stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved his results and the experimental design was by timing the time it took for them to stretch and changing it, either shortening it, or raising it. Also, the student could have drawn a graph to  better validify their results.
4886	2	(A) Based on the students data the plastics didn't have much of a difference from trial 1 to trial 2. ^p (B) The student could have improved the experimental validity by measuring each plastic the same length and adding more trials.
4887	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 types of plastic used for the experiment plastic type B  stretched the longest. the data shows that from trial 1 and 2 plastic type B measured ton 22 and 23. Two ways a student could have done to improve the experimental design is performing atleast 3 or more trials because the results may not be credible. Also, I would measure the weights put on the plastic to make sure its done evenly.
4888	2	A: Plastic type B is the most stretchable, plastic type. A is the least stretchable. ^p They could have done more than two trials.
4889	2	For T1 and T2 for the types of plastic it stays around the same area in (mm). So I think the amount stretched is correct.^p (b)Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by maybe the 2nd time leaving it longer than five minutes. Another change could have been to see what made it different the second time.
4890	2	a) Based on the results plastic type B had the greatest elasticity with an average length of 25 mm. The least elastic plastic was plastic A with an average length of 11mm.^p b) 1. Make all plastic begin at the same length.^p 2. Specify how much weight is to be added and make it a controlled variable.
4891	2	a) The results ranged very closely in numbers from trial 1 and 2 but plastic type D stretched the most. ^P b) The students should have done at loast one more trial and could have averaged cut the results for each plastic type.
4892	2	Plastic type B has the most amount stretched, where plastic type A has the least. The student could have improved her experiment by being more clear when it came to the procedure and by orginizing the procedure.
4893	2	a. There is wide variation in the stretchability of these polymers. b. They should have used a set amount of weight instead of varying it. They should have put the polymers to a specific sites. For example all polymers should have been 20cm by 5cm by 1cm. This way you climinate variation.
4894	2	Plastic B was the most stretched on both trials, therefor  I conclude that it is the most strechiest than the others. Plastic A was the one that less streched and there fore is the less strechiest of all. Plastic A is the strongest because it didn't strectch fastest and B is the weakest because it stretched the most in 5 mins. The student could have done another trial. The student as well have done different time periods such as 5, 10, 15 mins. Th studenst could have also say the amounts of weight put on.
4895	2	A could conclusion could be that plastic type D had the most amount that was stretched. ^p Also two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is ^p . Let the weights hang longer. ^p . More trials.
4896	2	After holding wieght the plastic has streched to be longer. ^P Always are how much wieght and ran more trials.
4897	2	A) In conclusion plastic D is harder to stretch than plastic plastic A. Plastic D stayed the same; as plastic A stretched 2mm more during T2 than in T1. ^p B) The student could have improve their experiment by adding a third trial and aloting us average to base their findings off of. also they could have said how much weight to add in each plastic.
4898	2	"The student's amounts were not that far apart from each other they were off by 1 or 2 until ""D"" when they were both equal with 20. 2 Ways this student could've improved the experimental design was to do the second trial a little bit different from the first trial to get better results and increase the time on maybe how long the student had her sample hanging."
4899	2	In conclusion more of the T2 have a high record then T1. Two way improved the experimental are measure length differently and types of plastic.
4900	2	To let the plastic hens longer put more weights on it.
4901	2	The student to test the stretchability of 4 different polymer plastics by taking a sample of on plastic measuring it and and then taping it to the table and adding weights to the plastic and letting it hang for 5 min then measure the ending length. The student noticed that plastic be did the best in both trials with 22mm in the first and 23 mm in the 2nd. Plastic D was the next best with 20 and 20 followed by plastic C. Plastic A did the worse with 10 mm and 12mm. Two ways the student could be improved their experimental design was to say the starting length and how many weights was used.
4902	2	a) Plastic type B was the most stretcheable plastic out of four (plastic A, B, C, D) materials, and plastic type A was the least streatcheable plastic. b) The students could have improved the experience by repeating the exact same experience again. The students could also have compared to other students who have done the same experience to see how accurate/ difference they have.
4903	2	a) Plastics A & C are the least flexible while B & C are the most. ^p b) They could have done another trial Added a varable
4904	2	A conclusion based on the students data is that they were trying to see which plastic is the strongest. The strongest is plastic B. ^p Two ways that the students could have the experimental design is by putting the more of the plastic. Also put the time.
4905	2	Two ways that the student colud improve his experiment is by first do a few more than just 2 trials maybe 3-5 would be good. Also make sure that all the plastic samples are the same length before stretching.
4906	2	Plastic B is the most stretchable plastic. The student could have improved the experimental design by using more detail. The student could have improved the validity of the results by.
4907	2	They could've measure or weighed how much weight they were going to add.
4908	2	a. Sample B  and D performed about twice as well as samples A and C. ^p b. The students could have described how the weights should be distributed and how should the tape be put on the plastic wrap at the top.
4909	2	Based on the data chart the conclusion that can be drawn are, when the plastic type D was stretched both times during the trials they stayed the same. Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by doing another head so their data can be accurate and using different types of plastic.
4910	2	a) a conclusion to the students data is the more the plastic type was putted the long it stretched. ^p b) The student could of did make trials, also they could of took the three highest stretched plastic and did a experiment, finding out which plastic stretched the longest out of the three.
4911	2	Based on the data of the student, plastic type D has the best stretchability and plastic type A has the worst to improve the experiment the children should have measure a plastic bag without clamp, as a control to compare data also another way to improve/ or validate data was to do another trial.
4912	2	a Plastic type A seems to be the most durable, judging by the fact that it only stretched 22mm in total.^p bThey could have added more trials and they could have specified if they added the weights in the same order every time.
4913	2	If he didn't do the same exact trial twice then he wouldn't get almost the exact same data. One way he could on changed it is by doing a different trial. Should of told us what are the polymer plastics for stretchability.
4914	2	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b. Add a control specify how much weight to put on the clamps.
4915	2	Based on the results of the student data results it is clear that no one of the polymer had much of a difference concerning how much they stretched the most one polymers was 2 mm which isn't that much. To improve the experiment the student could have used heavier weights for a more accurate measurement. Because the weights that were used didn't seem to have much of an effect. The student also could have found out what each type of polymer was before they started their experiment.
4916	2	a)Based on the data, plastic B was the most stretch capable plastic and plastic A was the least stretchable A was the least stretchable.^p (b)Two ways the student could have improved the design would have been by measuring the lengths of the plastic types before removing the weights and by performing a third trial to validify the results.
4917	2	The experiment isn't valid because there are 2 I V's which means you can draw the conclusion because they stretched the same plastic. I wi be so it you draw a conclusion you draw the difference between the two trials but other than that you can't draw the conclusion. If they would have how did the second trial when it would have worked.
7439	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are the same because they both only eat one type of food: which is bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. They're both different from pythons because they don't migrate from place to place. Also, they're both not as threatening as a python.
7441	3	China's panda and Australia's koalas are both specialist species. This means that they can only survive in specific regions due to their dietary and environmental needs. On the other hand, pythons are generalist species. The article states that they can live in many different regions on earth because they have less specific diet and climate requirements.
7444	3	They both have in common their are both big animals they are different because panda dasent eat notting but bamboo and eats alot of things paragraph 21.
7447	3	In China pandas each eat anthing, but bamboo and in Australia koala eat nothing but eucalyptus.
7448	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the eat certain things. In the article it state ""China panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, koala bear which eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively"". Pandas and koalas bear are different because they would eat alligator and many other things."
7449	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the article describes the both as specialists, or animals that can only survive. In very specific climates and environments. A python is a generalists, the opposite of specials, which the table describes as an animal that is able, to an extent to adapt to different environments.
7450	3	As said in the article china's panda which eat almost nothing but bamboo,or Australia's koalas bear which eats eucalyptus  leaves almost exclusively are both specialists and don't pase a threat .While on the other hand as said in the article,a generalist isa rarcoon, a python, a cockroach and white tailed  bear but pythons case a major threat because they're invasive.
7451	3	"Pandas in China and Koalas are in Australia are both ""specialists"" This means they can only thrive in very specific environment.Pandas eat primarily bamboo and Koalas almost exclusively eucalyptus and so are confined to the areas those grow in. Pythons on the other hand are generalists because they live many places and have many/widespread habitat which support their needs."
7453	3	"Pandas and Koalas are similar because they both eat nothing but leaves and bamboo, both are herbivores. They differ from pythons because these snakes can be dangerous to other organisms, ""a python swallowed an alligator"" (5).

7668	3	Pandas and Koalas are similar because their both bears but Pandas eat suged cans while Koalas eat let's and Pandas live in like a cool climenit but Koalas live in hot climent.
7671	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat plants. The pandas eat bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because they are specialists and the pythons are generalists. This means a specialist needs a constant resource to survive and the generalists have many resources to survive.
7673	3	pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because there both specialist. Something that doesn't live around humans and there different from pythons because python can live around humans, and in the text the author describes how people keep pythons as pets.
7674	3	"Pandas in china are similar to Australia koalas in sense that they are ""specialist species"". Also,they are both warm blooded animals. However,python are very different.They are considered to be ""generalist species""."
7676	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both pretty much eat only one type of food. Pandas eat ""almost nothing but bamboo"", koalas eat, ""eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They are both different from pythons because they eat anything including other wildlife."
7681	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because in the article it states that both koalas and pandas are specialists and they eat almost nothing but bamboo, or eucalyptus tress.
7684	3	According to the article pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves, so taking these animals from their original habitat would be kill them.
7685	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both can survive off of one type of food and one food only. They differ from pythons because a python will more than half of the time eat anything. In the article a python ate an alligator which shows that no animal is a threat to it. ""A python swallowed an alligator and..."""
7686	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eats pretty similar. I say this because ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". So therefore whats make them similar is that they only feed on one type of food. They are different from pythons because they can only live one place while pythons can live at many other. I say this because basically from the passage its saying that pythons can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space."
7688	3	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists who eat a type of plant but they are both different from a python because it is a generalist.
7689	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat only plants like the article, says pandas eat mostly nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, while pythons are carnivores they will eat other animals like in the article One mans pet,Another invasive species by Joel Achenbach ''A python swallowed an alligator.''
7690	3	They are both bears but with different style. And lifestyle. Ones eat bamboo the other one eats eucalyptus. But you can't compare the koala and the panda to a python. A python is a wild animal.
7691	3	Pandas and koala are very different from pythons. One is because pandas and koalas are mammals and pythons are reptiles and they eat meat. While panda eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
7693	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because in article it says ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."
7695	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists because they only eat one type of plant native to one type of place as stated in paragraph 22. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalist they can live anywhere because they don't have a specific food source they can be placed almost anywhere and survive.
7698	3	According to the article, pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist. Both pandas and koala's are different from python's because a python is a generalist such as a human being and can live anywhere imm a that climate too very cold climate.
7699	3	Panda's & koalas are the same by they both eat plants and live in jungles. they are both different from pythons because one's really big and a python is small.
7701	3	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they both eat just one thing, and live in a almost wear it's always the same. They are different from pythons because pythons are adapters and can/will eat almost everything. Pythons also don't need one type of terrain to live.
7702	3	Panda bears and koalas are similar because they are specialist species that live almost entirely on plants. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalist species that are reptile that live off of predation.
7705	3	How is Chinas Panda and koala bears are similar is that the China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and an Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. How they are different from pythons is By a python can eat an Alligator and a panda and China only can eat bamboo and eucalyptus.
7707	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both of them live in one general area and feed off of one specific plant, not anything else, bamboo for the panda and eucalyptus leave for the koala. The pythons however are different because they are slowly depleting. Some of the native species to extinction. So unlike the panda and koala the python is harming the natural habitats.
7708	3	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are very similar because they eat the same type of food everyday. The article, says that Panda's eat nothing but bamboo, and Koala's eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons becaus pythons eat a variety of food where Panda & Koala's dont.
7709	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. They eat one specific thing. Pandas only eat bamboo and koala who only eats eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because the are not generalist. Pythons can adapt almost anywhere.
7710	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. They are both specialist species. The panda only eats bamboo and the koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. These two animals differ from pythons because pythons are generalists. Pythons are invasive species, very much unlike the koala bear and panda.
7714	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, they eat specific types of food (koala eats eucalyptus leaves panda eats bamboo) and can't adapt that easily. They are different from pythons because pythons have adapted and live in other places rather than a specific place, and can eat a variety of things. A python is also a generalist and with the assistance of technology can live anywhere from Florida to Anatica.
7716	3	Panda's and koalas are similar because there both bears family.
7717	3	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists which are species that can only live in one habitat while the python is a generalist which can live anywhere. It says in the article ""A generalist is a caccoon, a pythons."" In the article it also says, "" A specialists is China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koalas."""
7719	3	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both exclussive animals. They both differ from a python because, in paragraph 20, it says that pythons often do best in and around humans.
7723	3	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat plants and they're different from pythons because they don't eat other animals and pythons have a harder time adapting to a new environment.
7728	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas jin Australia because they both only eat one thing. In the article it says, A specialist in China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo. Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. There different to pythons because pythons eat almost about everything.
7730	3	"Pandas and koalas only eat one plant and thats it. ""A specialist is China's panda which eats nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". Pythons can eat almost anything from rats, humans, other types of mice and alligators. Pandas & koalas are in jeopardy of becoming extinct b/c of their selective eating."
7732	3	The pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both mammals, both bears and have fur. Scientist think that they are linked to one another.
7734	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia but are both different from pythons because they are less harmful and won't become extinct as fast. According to the article,"" We're degrading the earth at an alarming rate. ""In other words these pythons are becoming extinct in the wildlife faster than the species in China and Australia."
7737	3	Chinas pandas that eat bearly anything that's not bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves. They both are much different from pythons that eats almost anything. Pandas and koalas which are mammals are warm and furry but pythons and other lizards are less well supported.
7741	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat items that do not have an effect on animals. They are both different from pythons because when dealing with pythons you have animals who feast upon other animals they may quickly become extinct. "" We're degrading the Earth at a charming rate"" claims Mac Innes.  Clearly pythons are not healthy because  environment and the animals  people who adapts to those environments."
7744	3	Pandas in China are like koalas in that, they both eat a specific thing, abundant in one place. Pythons are different because they can get things like food, not entirely from anywhere like the burmese pythons in Florida. Their survival isn't dependant on one place.
7746	3	Pandas in China are similar to kolas in Australia by they only eat one food source. They are both driffent from pythons because they are specialist and are more stable then pythons with are generalists. Generalists are able to change.
7747	3	China panda and koala are both similar because thier both under the same category,specialist. They both eat plants almost all the time, and they have to be stabled. Now China panda & koalas are both different from pythons because they are under the category, generalist. Pythons can live anywhere from Florida to Antartica to outer space. They don't have to be stabled.
7749	3	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat the same source of food, while a snake can adapt to almost any climate and any human.. specialist cannot.
7753	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas and koalas eat plants which pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons by this predator can spread and its habitat stretching from California to Delaware. You can conceivably have pythons stretching their way straight up the Potomac.
7755	3	A panda is like a koala because they both need to be somewhere specific to survive. A panda needs to be in Chine because it needs to eat bamboo and a koala needs to be in Australia so it can eat eucalyptus. A python is different though because it will be able to find food almost any where, so where it lives doesn't matter as much.
7756	3	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Specialists are animals the are probably exclusive to a certain food source. Pands eat almost nothing but bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. ""Both these animals differ from pythons because pythons are generalists meaning they have a range of food sources. Hence they differ from Pandas and Koalas because of their amount of food sources."
7757	3	Each the panda and koala are part of the bear family and are also warm blooded mammals. Besides that they are also herbivores and mostly eat one thing. In contrast to the python who is a cold blooded carnivores reptile.
7759	3	"Pandas and koalas are similar in that they eat almost one thing exclusively "" China's pand... eats almost nothing but bamboo,"" Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These animals are very different because pythons will eat almost any thing ranging from a rat to an aligator."
7760	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because those animals are native to that area. Also, they are mammals. But, pythons could most likely live in the North if they were brought here. Pythons also are less supported in our culture, we normally prefer mammals.
7761	3	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are specialists. They both have a set diet, pandas only probably eat bamboo and Koalas practically only eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are generalists with the right sources. Pythons can live anywhere, generalists are usually more abundant because they can survive in more than one place. The pythons have this advantage over the panda (only China) and Koala (Australia).
7762	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat almost exclusively on one type of plant. Biologists believe that invasive species such as the Burmese python and the Nile monitor lizard are types of natural predators that could be major threats to biodiversity.
7767	3	The 2 animals both eat one thing only, and they are not reptiles a python is a reptile.
7768	3	Pandas and koalas both only eat one food.
7769	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because in paragraph 21 is says that they're specialist. Pandas in China eat almost nothing but bamboo while koalas in Australia eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They both differ from a python because in paragraph20 it says pythons are generalist and they are species that have become most abundant and do best in and around humans.
7772	3	A panda in China is an animal that is kept in the wild, just like a koala. They eat food that is in there natural habitat. A python that is kept as a pet needs to adapt the food its owner gives him, rather than what he would normally eat in the wild.
7773	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat plants and they're innocent creatures. Pythons, on the other hand, are invasive animals. They eat meat and they're huge. According to the article in 2005 a python swallowed an entire alligator. Pandas and koalas would never do that.
7774	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are limited to what they eat. They're both different from pythons because pythons can eat various things. This means there will be more pythons than koalas and pandas.
7775	3	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because, they both feed off of one main food: A specialist is china's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are also both specialists because they are only able to live long in their own habitats.
7776	3	Koalas and Panda's are similar because they both only eat one thing. Panda's eat bamboo and Koala bear on eats eucalyptus. That's what also makes them different than a python because python's will eat anything that has meat.
7777	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they live off of one specific food source. That could make things difficult to live without or possibly die without food source. They differ from pythons because a python is a generalists which can adapt to other life styles quicker than the specialists.
7778	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, which means that they eat a very limited variety of foods. The panda eats "" almost nothing but bamboo"" while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They differ from the python which can survive in a large variety of places."
7782	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat only one type of food, where as pythons can eat birds, rodents, and other small animals. That's why pandas and koalas aren't as high in number as pythons they have a limited food supply.
7783	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. This means they can only survive in the area where their food is and climate is perfect for them. Pandas have bamboo in China and koala's have eucalyptus in Australia. Their both different from pythons because pythons are generalist and can survive in many places.
7785	3	A panda is like a koala because both animals need a certain place in order to live. Those two animals can not live just anywhere because their diets are limited to mainly one plant. These two animals are not like pythons because pythons can pretty much eat anything and be satified. I know python's would eat anything because in paragraph 14 it stated how a python ate a alligator.
7786	3	"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas bears in Australia because they both eat certain type of food. ""China's Panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. ""These two species eat one certain food, while pythons can eat any kind of mammal that's small enough. Pandas nor Koalas eat meat either, just vegetation."
7787	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the have the same diet and live in the same habitat. They are different from pythons, because pythons do not eat plants like pandas and the koalas, and they also don't live in the forest like them, because pythons eat other animals, and there aren't many  other animals in their habitat.
7788	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in the same climate and have same alike features. They're different from pythons because a python is a reptile and they're not.
7789	3	These two animals are similar because they are both specialist species. They are both different from pythons, are that pythons are a generalists species so there are two diffrents types.
7790	3	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they eat almost one type of plant while pythons have a variety of things they will eat.
7791	3	Panda's and koala's are both similar because the are both specialists. Both of these animals are accustomed to one thing such as food. A python however, is a generalist which is something that can live in different environments. Unlike a panda or a koala, pythons can adapt to its surrounding quite quickly, but a panda cannot because it will have no food source.
7792	3	Pandas in China are similar to koala in Australia are similar because according to the article they are picky  eaters in that the panda will only feast on bamboo and the koala will only eat eucalyptus. This makes them different from python because pythons are generalist while koalas and pandas are specialist.
7793	3	Panda's in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they are mamals in the story it said ''mamals are warm and fuzzy.'' These two animals are different from pythons because pythons are reptiles.
7795	3	"Pandas and Koalas are similar because they only eat one thing. In the article it says, ""Panda eat almost nothing but bamboo,"" Also it says ""Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Pythons are different because they can eat more variars things."
7797	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because the animals both live in warmer climates and they are both mammals. The panda and koala are different from pythons because pythons are reptiles and pythons don't have any arms or legs to move around unlike the panda and the koala.
7800	3	China's panda and Australia's koala are both of the same general bear species. They also are both said to eat one specific and exclusive thing according to the article. Panda's eat bamboo and koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. The animals are are also significantly less harmful compared to snakes and pythons.
7801	3	The pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia int the way of they're both specialist and they cant be taken out of their natural habitat. They're different from the python because the python is a generalist and adapt to different environments.
7802	3	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia  are both alike because all they eat is one particular type of food on the other hand pythons eat variaus species that could effect our environment if had become extinct.
7805	3	Pandas in China are different to koalas in Australia because pandas, eats almost nothing but bamboo and koala bears which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both similar because they are both bear's.
7806	3	According to the article pandas + koalas are similiar compared to pythons because of there species. Pandas + koalas both eat only one specific type of food bamboo + eucalyptus, found in their native countries. Whereas pythons are generalist species (unlike specialist) + can live any where due to their wide range in appetite. If pandas or koalas moved they'd die.
7811	3	Pandas and koalas are both only able to eat one type of food witch is bamboo for the panda and eucalyptus leaves foe the koala. Unlike the boa constricted wich can eat anything and can adapt quickly to new environment.
7813	3	Well pandas and koalas are similar because they both pretty and cannot live anywhere that don't have bamboo or eucalyptus because like the article said they can only eat that while snakes could eat almost anything.
7825	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because it states in paragraph number 21, that both the 2 animals live on on mostly one thing; bamboo for the panda, and leaves for the koala rather then the python who lives & eats off a majority of foods.
7826	3	Pandas koalas are alike because they both rely on 1 source of food like bamboo (panda) or eucalyptus leaves (koala). Pythons however rely on many different animals as food sources and depends on all of them.
7827	3	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialist animals. They are because they only eat a certain type of food. Whereas the python can live anywhere. In the article it says, ""it says, ""one specimen of which, tagged with a radio transmitter was tracked to the belly at snake."" This shows snakes will eat anything including rats."
7828	3	Panda's in China are just like koalas in Australia because they are ''specialist.'' They both also only eat one type of food, pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. But they are very different from pythons because pythons are ''generalist'', who can adapt to live anywhere and pythons also eat anything the can fit in their mouth.
7829	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by they both only eat plants, no meat. In the article it says pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves. The panda & koala bears differ from a python, because a python will eat anything, for example in the article it says a python swallowed an alligator.
7830	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat leaves and maintain there habitat. They are different from pythons because they eat anything as far as meat. They are also expanding to different parts of the U.S. The map shows that they are in CA, TX, UA,and all the South parts.
7831	3	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat stuff from like trees and they both are bears.Pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because in the story it says how pythons can live anywhere but the panda and koala can't and pythons spreads and live more than the pandas.
7832	3	Both pandas in China and koalas in Australia are specialists, they survive off of only one type of food. They can only live where they can get there specific foods, they are different from pythons which are generalists, they can survive off of a much broader food supply and as shown in a USGS map they are capable of inhabiting climates from Deleware to California.
7836	3	Pandas and koalas are both specialist species, surviving on one specific food daily, and a python is a generalist species living almost anywhere suitable. That's what makes them different.
7838	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists species. This means that they need more specific environments to survive, for example, a panda ""eats almost nothing but bamboo."" They are both different from pythons because pythons are a generalist species which means they can survive with a variation of food and in many different environments."
7839	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both have one kind of food they eat. Pandas always eat bamboo also known as one of the hardest things to break, and koalas exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves.
7841	3	China bears and koalas in Australia are similar because China's panda eat nothing but bamboo and Austulias koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves, they are different from pythons because China's panda and Austulias koalas are specialist and pythons are generalists.
7845	3	Pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both do best in and around humans. Also in paragraph 21 it says that panda only eat: nothing but bamboos and koala's eat eucalyptus thats the only differents.
7851	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialist species. They both exclusively out only one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These species are different than pythons because pythons are generalist species. Pythons adapt their eating habits to whats around them while pandas and koalas do not.
7852	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia are similar because they are both vegitanars. They are also similar, because they are both generalists. This means that they can survive in a lot of habitats. Pandas can where there is bamboo and koalas where there are eucalyptus leaves. They are also very different from pythons, because they are not an invasive species that kill and eats just about anything that is in front of them.
7853	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists. They both must live in a specific habitat. A panda needs bamboo and a koala needs eucalyptus leaves. Pythons can live in more than one parts of the southern U.S, making them more generalists rather than specialists.
7857	3	Both pandas and koalas are specialists. They eat only a certain thing. Pythons are generalists. They adapt better and can change themselves to match the environment.
7859	3	The Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are similar because they only eat certain things that grow in thier habitat where the pythons can eat anywhere because all they need are small animals like rats which are found just about everywhere.
7860	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat a very small amount of food.What I mean with that is that ""pandas eat nothing but bamboos"" like the author says. While koalas eat only ""eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"", like the author says. So basicly their similar because they eat in small variety of food. Then there both different from pythons because like I said China pandas & koala's eat a small variety of food while pythons eat anything and everything. For example, like something so shocking when in the Everglades in 2005 a python ate an alligator and thats something rare and it happened only because pythons have a taste for many varieties of food."
7861	3	Pandas in China are similar to Australian koalas because they both eat mainly one thing pandas eat mainly bamboo and koala bears eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. they are different from pythons because pythons can live in any where and still be able to find food.
7863	3	Both pandas and koalas are alike, but differ from pythons. They are alike because they both eat only one thing and stay in the same environment. They are different from pythons because pythons are spreading and multiplying unlike koalas and pandas. This is how they are similar, but different than pythons.
7865	3	Unlike pythons both pandas and koalas, eat for the most part only one type of food that cannot be found all over the world. The pythons diet allows them to survive  almost anywhere climate allows while koalas and pandas are confined in their food sources.
7868	3	The article states that pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only survive in specific locations. Pandas and Koalas are  different from pythons because pythons are generalist species. They can live and survive in different parts of the world.
7871	3	Pandas are similar to koalas because both are specialist animals and eat only a certain kind of food: Because of this, they can only survive in certain environments. However, they are different from pythons because pythons are generalist animals that have a large variety of food sources. Since pythons have many foo sources, they can live in more places than pandas and koalas.
7873	3	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. They both can only survive off one food source; bamboo for panda and eucalyptus leaves for the koalas. They are different from the python because pythons are generalist species. Pythons thrive from change and can adapt to new habitats. The pythons can change habits to suit needs whereas the pandas and koalas would die.
7874	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because as the author says they are specialist meaning that most of the time they need a key factor to survive in the world. As compared to pythons, which are generalist, meaning that is easier to adapt to a different environment.
7875	3	Pandas and koalas are both specialist species and are both herbivores. The python by contrast, is a carnivore and generalist specie. Generalists, like the python, favor change while specialists, like the pandas and koalas, favor stability.
7876	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because these species are both specialists and mainly rely on one food source. Pandas almost only eat bamboo and koalas almost only eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals can only live in areas where these foods can be found. Pythons on the other hand are generalists and eat a variety of food. Thus, unlike koalas and pandas, pythons can live in a greater variety of places.
7879	3	Pandas are similar to koalas in Australia cause they both eat plants. They aren't harming anyone or anything around them. The China pandas eat bamboo and that's basically all. The koala from Australia eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. So they aren't as dangerous as the pythons that can harm their owner.
7880	3	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both eat natural plants/trees they dont kill to survive pythons are predators they kill and attack other animals. They can cause extinction and alanger to other animals and people.
7882	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. This means that they both mainly only eat one food, unlike the python. The difference between panda/ koala and python is that pythons are generalists and eat many things while pandas and koalas are specialists.
7883	3	"Pandas and koalas are both specialists and eat stritly one plant. A specialist is China's ;panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" (p 21). They both differ from pythons because they're specialists and pythons are generalists. ""A generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white tailed deer."" (p 20)."
7885	3	"The Chinese panda and Australian koala are similar because they only eat one kind of food. To quote the author, China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This means that these two animals are limited almost entirely to the region their specific food grows, whereas pythons are ""generalists"" and can eat multiple things."
7888	3	"Panda's and koalas are the same because they are harmless. They are different because Pandas eat bamboo and koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. In the story it says ""china's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves... ""meaning the are harmless animals because don't fear of humans."
7889	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar because they both eat mainly one thing and both like warm climate and are both under threat of being extinct. They are different from pythons because pythons eat more than one thing and there population is growing.
7890	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat one thing. It says ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" It is dif. from a python because they eat many things and are very dangerous."
7894	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas because they both eat a certain material, pandas eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves, so they can only live were those things grow, China for pandas and Astrelia for a koalas, but pythons can eat a more wide varity of food so they are lest restricted on where they can live.
7896	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist and both eat mainly one thing. In the article it says how China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They're different from pythons because pythons are generalist and they eat animals, many different animals. That's the difference.
7901	3	Both China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they both only eat certain foods. China's panda only eats bamboo most of the time, and Australia's koala that absolutly eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. But they are most different from the python which will eat anything from a grasshopper to a house or deer.
7904	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists and they both only eat one type of food. The pandas almost exclusively bamboo and the koala almost only eats eucalyptus leaves. Both of these animals are different from a python because it is a generalist.
7905	3	A China's panda eats bamboo and a Australia koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves are similar and a python (lizard) is a too my carnivore that can reach seven feet in heght and can be found in the canals of cape coral.
7906	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, because they most live in certain environments and eat certain foods.  The panda only eat bamboo, while the koala favors eucalyptus trees. The python differs than these two because it can survive in a combination of different habitats, like a home or the wild, and eat a whole range of food from an alligator to rats. Pythons are generalists.
7907	3	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they both are specialist species. Panda usually always eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from the pythons because they only eat one main food source. Pythons have eaters rats and crocodiles which shows us that they can definitely eat something large and dangerous. Their food source really varies.
7908	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because in the article it said, ""Chinas panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala, which eats leaves most exclusively."" They both are carnevores. Pythons are meat eaters, ""A python swallowed an alligator."" The article told me that so that's how they are different."
7909	3	Pandas and koalas are similar in ways. One is because both eat mainly one thing. There both different to pythons because pythons eat anything.
7914	3	This article says that China's panda and Australia's koala bear don't eat the same thing base on the environment China's panda only eats bamboo and the Australa's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves.
7915	3	"The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both ""specialists"" which means that they can eat only one type of food source. The pandas eat only ""bamboo"" and the koala only eats ""eucalyptus leaves."" They are diffent to a python is because, a python is a generalists. Which means that a python could basically eat more than one type of food."
7916	3	Pandas are similar to koalas because they don't eat other animals. They only eat bamboo and eucalyptus while the pythons can eat another alligator. The pythons are more dangerous.
7918	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat a certain number of plants pretty much exclusively. They are both different than pythons because with the assisstance of technology and humans, generalists (such as pythons) can live almost anywhere. MacInnes added that generalists favor change and specialists favor stability.
7919	3	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia by them both only eating almost nothing but one thing. For example, the panda eats bamboo, and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves they are different from pythons by not being dangerous, and pythons eat more than one thing such as diffferent animals,etc.
7922	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Their diet consists of mainly one food and if they were to go to an area without that food they would die. But the python is a generalist. It can live in many different climates and ecosystems and still survive by changing their diet and eating a variety of things. One snake even tried to eat an alligator.
7924	3	China's panda and Australia's koala are both specialists. The exclusively eat one one food source. For the panda it's bamboo, for koala's it is eucalyptus leaves. A python is not a specialist it's a generalist. It can basically adapt to any environment it's thrown in as long as there's a second hand source of help. For humans, who are also generalists, this would be technology.
7925	3	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists who can't survive in all environments. Both these animals are different than pythons because the article states that pythons are generalist who can easily adapt to a certain environment unlike pandas and koalas that can not.
7927	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because  they are considered "" Specialist species"" Which means they only can live in one habitat and this is because of their food sources which can only be found locally. These two animals are different from a python because a python is a reptile and can survive in a wider variety of habitats."
7929	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they're both specialists, wich is stabil and stays the same while a python is a generalist wich adats by changing and will change what they eat while pandas and koalas eat the same thing and wont eat anything else.
7931	3	Pandas in China are like koalas in Australia because they both are specialist. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalist.
7935	3	"Pandas in China, like koalas in Australia, are known as ""specialists"". They eat only one food source. In th case of th pandas, this is bamboo, and for the koalas it's eucalyptus leaves. This is different from pythons because, according to the eticle, python's are known as ""generalists"" which means that they can live anywhere and don't have to stay near a specific food source."
7940	3	"Pandas in China are similar becase they both eat organic food. He says ""mammals are warm and fuzzy"" because thats what they are and there the opposite of pythons."
7941	3	The panda and koala are both herbivores and live in regions where their food is Abundant and their habitat disturbs no other animals. In the articles, it says mammals are fuzzy and warm while, lizards and snakes tend to be less well-respected and supported. Pythons are carnivores who swallow their prey whole. Putting a python anywhere, but Its ardused habitat would either disturb or destroy it.
7942	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat only one thing. Therefore, if the food that they eat is not available they would die off. Pythons on the other hand can adjust to the environment. For example, according to paragraph 11 and 14, a python ate an endangered species and another one attempted to eat an alligator.
7943	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. Pandas almost only eat bamboo and koalas almost only eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists, they can live almost anywhere and will change to fit their climate and surroundings.
7945	3	Pandas and koalas eat bamboo and eucalyptus tree leaves. They both are animals that eat tree like things. They're completely different from snakes because snakes don't have legs or fur or eat bamboo or leaves.
7948	3	They are both living in their natural habitats and they are both different from pythons because they don't eat the same things, they don't live in the same habitat. Pythons are reptiles and koalas and pandas are not.
7950	3	The pandas in China eat almost nothing but bamboo. Just like pandas, the koalas in Australia stick specifically to eating basically just eucalyptus leaves. Pythons however eat a wide range of food. Anywhere from common field mice to crocodiles! Pythons are much more divers than Pandas form China and koalas form Australia.
7953	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both are herbivores because pandas eat only bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves most of the time. Both of these animals are different from pythons because, pythons can live only hot places such as Texas, Florida etc, but animals such as koalas and pandas can live anywhere because they eat mostly plants.
7954	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat one specific type of food. They don't have any other species. @ A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". These animals are different from pythons because they don't eat other animals. They are also specialists, while pythons are generalists."
7956	3	The panda and the koala are similar becaus they both eat plants. And they are both different from pythons is that pythons eat anything and the panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus.
7957	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. They only eat a certain thing that is only grown in the habitat they're in. These animals are both different from a python because in the article, it states that a python is a generalist species and can pretty much be found anywhere; unlike the panda & koala bear.
7959	3	Pandas and Koalas bears are similar because they both eat nature food like they said in the article, Pandas eat mostly bamboo and Koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves, but they are both different from the pythons because the pythons eat other animals such as crocodeles.
7960	3	Chin's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves about exclusively.
7962	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist species. The article says that they only eat one type of food exclusively which means they can only survive in certain areas. Pythons are generalists which show that they can survive and live in multiple environmental zones unlike the panda & koala such is shown by the reptile map.
7963	3	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears in Australia's because they don't eat meat they eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. The reason why they are different from pythons is because they are cut and friendly and don't try killing things unlike pythons with there tongs, scales and desting tounges arn't friendly and try to kill.
7967	3	Pandas in China and Koala. bears are similar because they seem to be herbevours (they only eat plants). And they both differ from pythons because.
7973	3	Panda and Koalas are similar because they are both herbivores in which they don't eat animal and only plant. Pythons is a reptile that is a carnivore and predator only meets.
7974	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. They eat almost only bamboo and eucalyptus respectively and therefore can only live in selected places with these. Pythons however, are generalists and can live in a vast variety of places and flourish. This is how they are different.
7981	3	Pandas in China are similar in Koalas in Australia because as the articles said , they are both specialist. Both of these species depend on almost one food source alone making them different from pythons who can easily adapt and part a multitude of things.
7984	3	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both are specialist, not household pets and can live off at one thing to eat for their whole life. But that factor also makes them different to pythons because pythons cant live off of any I food source. Another difference is that pythons are a threat to the food eyese. (paragraph 14) a python eats a crocodile this then could mess up the food cycle.
7986	3	Pandas are similar to koalas becaus they both only eat one thing. Both are different from pythons because pythons have multiple diferent feed sources.
7988	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they're both specialists. They both eat a special food, and would have trouble surviving in areas without this specific food. ""China's panda ... eats almost nothing but bamboo (and) Australia's koala bear... eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. ""They're both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, it can survive in many different places, as well as eat a variety of foods, unlike koalas & pandas, which can only live certain foods are grown."
7993	3	China's panda is a specialist that eats nothing but mainly bamboo, Australias koala is also a specialist which eats eucalyptus which leaves almost exclusively. A python is a generalist that can live anywhere and eat anything it sees.
7994	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because in the article it says that pandas eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves which makes them vegans. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are meat eats according to the article, some animals can be different and some the same.
7996	3	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia have a few things in common. One of these things is that they both have one main food source. Bamboo being for the pandas and eucalyptus leaves for the koalas. Also, both of these animals are described as being specialists.
7997	3	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are both specialists. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This differs from pythons, which are specialists that feed on other species such as crocodiles and rodents.
8000	3	Panda in China and koalas in Australia are specialists. Pandas eat almost nothing except for bamboo and koalas almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. They cannot live where their food source isn't available. Pythons are generalist, though they can eat a wide array of food and can adapt to live i a wider range of places, such as potentially a third of the U.S.
8001	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the are both are both harmless and also none of the eats meat ""chinas panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, a Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". These two animals are for from being to a python because their not as dangerous could pythons are generalist, those two are specialist."
8002	3	The panda is different from a koala bear because pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. As said on page 5 prg 2. The two are different from pythons because they can walk and a python cant and they eat different foods.
8004	3	Panadas in China and koalas in Australia are alike because they can only live in their native area. Pandas primarily eat bamboo which grows in abundance in china but not many other places in the world. Same with koala who eat eucalyptus leaves. Unlike the panada and koala, pythons eat other animals so it is much easier for them to adapt to new places.
8005	3	Pandas and koalas are both native to where they come from. Pandas almost eat nothing but bamboo, that grows mostly in China. Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Australia and China provide pandas and koalas food source. Pythons eat rodents which are everywhere, therefore they are able to migrate easily unlike pandas and koalas.
8006	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both considered specialists. Both animals eat certain food that grows only in certain areas. In the article it states, ""a specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". This shows that they can only live in these areas because of what they eat, which i different from pythons who can live anywhere in the world that is the right climate."
8007	3	The pandas in China and the koala bears in Australia are specialists. They practically only eat certain things. Pandas mainly eat bamboo and koalas mainly eat eucalyptus leaves. The foods that they pretty much thrive on are mainly found in their native countries, those they were put in a different place like the python they wouldn't survive the pyt6hon can survive in a foreign country because it is generalists, meaning it can eat a variety of things.
8009	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they come from the same species. They both are different from pythons because pythons survive in the warm/hot climate and pandas and koalas doesn't.
8010	3	Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in  Australia in the aspect that both eat only one specific food. Both are different from a python because pythons can live anywhere and pandas and koalas need to live in certain places for their food source.
8011	3	Pandas in China and koala bears in Australia differ from pythons because pandas and koala bears only eat one food and only have one food source and could live really anywhere. But on the other hand pythons have a certain environment and have to have certain foods and can't live anywhere. Pandas and koalas are generalists and pythons are specialists.
8013	3	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists species. They both eat only one plant. They were different from pythons because pythons are generalist so they eat many things.
8015	3	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are alike because they both depend on one specific food to stay alive. The pandas feed off of bamboo which is almost exclusively in China and Australia and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves which are found in Australia. Because of this, both species are not suitable to live anywhere but their native lands. This makes them different from pythons, because pythons can live in a wide variety of places without a limitation on food.
8020	3	Pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and pythons is a snake that could eat almost anything they are different because the panda and koala hardly eat anything and the snake eats whatever.
8021	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia differ from pythons because that is the only place their food can grow. In paragraph 20-21 the artical tells how pythons can live in alot of places because there is food. Unlike pandas and koalas which have food that can only be grown in certain paces.
8022	3	China's panda's and Australia's koalas are similar because they both only consume one food source which is exclusive to the country which they live in. But these two animals are different from pythons because they will eat anything they can find for example a python tried to swallow a alligator but exploded.
8025	3	China's panda is native to China and the koala bear is native to Australia. But because an lot of people are buying pythons and other reptiles, the pythons aren't native to a place. In the article it says that a python is a generalist and panda and koala bears are specialist.
8026	3	Koala bear and pandas are the same because there two animals that only eat plants. Koala bear and pandas are different from python because python eat meat.
8027	3	Pandas are like koalas bears, because both species have species dietary needs. These two animals are unlike pythons, because pythons will eat about anything from wood rats to alligators. Pandas mainly eat bamboo and kolas bear mostly eat eucalyptus leaves.
8028	3	"The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both eat one certain food. ""Panda...(eat) nothing but bamboo...koala bear...eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They both are different from pythons because they both adapted to their area. However, the python couldn't adapt to his surroundings."
8029	3	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are animals and they are also dangerous. Also they are different from pythons because pythons are found everywhere.
8030	3	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they have to adapt to their environment, they have to tend for themselves since they're becoming ""invasive"" and invasive can lead to endangered -extinct. However these animals are different from pythons because pythons can be handled as house pets."
8032	3	"How pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and how they both are similar from pythons because pandas and koalas both eat healthy foods but pythons eat anything vared. In the article ""China's period which eats almost nothing but baristion or Australia's koalas bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" See pandas and koalas eat healthy."
8033	3	A panda in China and koala bear in Australia are similar because they both eat like plants or something tree related. They dont seem harmful to the people and they either stay in the forest or at the zoo. But pythons are carnivores they would probably attack it they see a person. They are wildlife that are probably all over the place. Which is bad because its a reptile.
8038	3	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists animals. They both have to live in certain places because they need certain food to live. They are both different from pythons because pythons can live anywhere cause they eat other animals.
8040	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both pretty much eat one thing which are plants. The python on the other hand compared to the other mammals will eat pretty much anything and they need to adapt to climate.
8045	3	"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialist & are mammals. However they are both different from a python because a python is a reptile. Reptiles had to eat meat and in the article it says that pandas 'eat almost nothing but bamboo, and the Koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This is how a panda & Koala are different from a python."
8046	3	China's panda and Australia's koalas are very much alike because they are both specialists. Both animals live of one type of food source and they are very different from pythons because pythons are generalists. Pythons can live off more than one food supply, and for that reason, they are dangerous.
8048	3	Theyare similar to koalas because both only eat one kind of food. In the pythons case it can eat all kinds of animals with meat. Also are able to suit more climates.
8054	3	Pandas and koala koala bears are similar because they only eat one thing. Also they can only live in one climate state because they need the right food. They are different then a python because pythons can live anywhere and adapt but like i said pandas and koala bears can't.
8055	3	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat one thing. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because the python could never survive in the panda or koala bears climates.
8061	3	"According to the article, China's panda and Australia's koala bear are similar but they both only eat one food; for pandas they only eat bamboo and koala bears only eat eucalyptus leaves as it says in paragraph 21. But pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because pythons are more around humans"".. because most abundant are often those that do best in and around humans."" The panda/koalas lives are different to pythons."
8066	3	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because there both dangerous animals. There both different from pythons because people have pythons as pets.
8067	3	Koalas and panda are both similar in that they are both specialists. Koala's like panda's eat one food source. The koala eats eucalyptus leaves and the panda eats bamboo. They differ from the python because it is a generalist its food sources may vary from birds to rodents etc.
8068	3	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat plant, the panda specie eat bamboo and the koala eat eucalyptus leaves. they are also similar because they both represent  a country. I think the python is different because it only eats other animals, and it doesn't represent a country.
10389	4	"The author uses the word ""invasive"" to get a reaction and feeling out of the reader. An example of this is, ""... as a factor in the rising number of invasive species..."". The author included the word ""invasive"" to make the reader think and have a feeling towards it. If the author had just said ""species"". The reaction to the article would have been different."
10391	4	In signifigance to the rest of the article, the word invasive means that a species is commonly found in places where it is a hazard for humans and wildlife. Drag hundreds of pythons out of the weeds , off roadways and even a torists car (4). The python can be a danger to people trying to relocate them. This is what the word species means in signifigance to the article.[
10392	4	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of this article because it stirs up some commotion. MacInnes thinks it is unfair to call the wild animals invasive because they are just being introduced to the habitat. Some think they are invasive and dangerous if they are unchecked living in our environment, which is actually the environment of the animals too."
10393	4	The keep multiple and are invading the United States.
10401	4	"The word ""invasive"" is just a scientific term they use for people pets such as pythons, or alligators and etc (reptiles)."
10404	4	Invasive species is a tone that is thought to be considered unfair by people who encourage moving reptiles as pets and is thought to be the correct lean for them. With reptiles, one man's pet ( the supported) is another mans invasive species ( opposers).
10407	4	"The term ""invasive"" in this article is pertaining to an animal or group of animals that exist in a habitat where they tend to kill off other species. Cobras or pythons for instance are considered invasive due to their tendencies to disrupt the lifestyle of the native species in the area that they live in."
10409	4	The significance of the word invasive is that its degrading to the animals who havent done anything to deserve, that. The animals aren't invasive and Bob Boy is trying to show that.
10411	4	The term invasive is unfair to all species, it seems that the government overestimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles. These species shouldn't be treated as if they are a threat to human life because in away they are just like us, doing what they need to do to survive and take care of their young.
10412	4	I think the meaning of the word invasive is dangerous. I think this because the article mainly talks about how dangerous some pets can be and their affects. The author says that a Pakistan black cobra writhes in its enclosure and strikes again and again at a thin glass separating the creature from a visitor.
10414	4	The world invasive is significant because part of the article is about different species invading places where they are not native. There is also a point in the article where there is an argument about whether they are invasive or introduced.
10422	4	Mac Innes thinks that ''They're introduced.'' I think 'invasive' is passing judgement. ''He says that the introduction of pythons is the best thing to happen to Florida in the last 200 yrs. But most people think otherwise. Skips Nowlias helped pull pythons out of weeds, off the roads and even out of tourist car's.
10423	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that it means unwanted preditors. The reason is that this article explains how pythons ended up in the Everglades.
10424	4	"The word invasive is a bias. According to the article paragraph 7, the man states ""invasive is passing judgement."""
10425	4	In this article I have seen the word ''invasive'' numerous times. In the article they said ''Even the term ''invasive species'' is unfair.'' They also said ''I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement. From reading in context clues I think the word invasive means dangerous or harmful species.
10427	4	The term invasive is an unfair word to use. And many people use this term to identify reptiles. Instead of invasive MacInnes says that they're introduced, and invasive is passing judgement.
10428	4	Invasive is another word for cold-blooded. The article states '' which is breeding up a storm in the Everglades.'' In conclusion the Everglades are cold, so invasive species must be cold blooded species to live in a cold area.
10436	4	"Invasive, to the article, meaning it can live just about anywhere like humans. As the title says ""one man's pet, Another invasive species"" meaning, because humans are taking animals eat of their natural environments they are adapting to new surroundings and being ""invasive"" or able to live in more than one place."
10437	4	"The word invasive is significant to the article because it shows that many people don't want invosive species coming here, because the word invasive is used rather than introduced. Mac Innes said, ""I think that invasive is passing judgement"" (4). This shows the significance of the word invasive."
10438	4	The significance of the word invasive is most likely dangerous or harmful. I say this because in the article it says biologists, however, say that invasive species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity.
10445	4	Invasive in this article is of significance because it means unnatural or imported to this habitat. This it criticl to the article because the python is invasive to the US.
10449	4	"Invasive basically means that things are running wild. The word invasive is significant in this article because the article is talking about how there are many ""invasive species"" running around in the everglades and other places."
10451	4	"The significance of the word invasive it shows that they can be dangerous and there are alot of them that can spread . "" MacInnes contends that the government over estimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles, "" They are dangerous but then they aren't because some live with people."
10453	4	The significance of the word invesive is to show how deadly reptiles can be. In paragraph a it states, biologists, however say that invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity also Mac Innes contends that government overestimates the treat pused by invasiveer reptiles.
10454	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is wild. The word ""invasive"" can be harmful to reptile owners because they don't look at their animals as ""invasive"". The store owner RobRoy MacInnes says the term ""invasive species"" is unfair ...I think that ""invasive"" is passing judgement."""
10455	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of this article is that invasive' suggests the species does not belong and is taking over something that doesn't belong to them. RobRoy Maclnnes finds the term unfair and prefers the term ""introduced"". The rest of the article describes the reactions of invasive species in ""new"" environments."
10456	4	"The word invasive is significant to the article because it describes animals taken from foreign countries that are brought to the United States.""Biologist see the trade in nonnative species as a factor in the rising number of invasive species. This quote supports my statement because it shows biologist think that foreign animals are invasive."
10458	4	Invasive means that other animals are adapting to States and taking evey thing.
10463	4	Invasive means to take away of good predator, people think dangerous.
10465	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that many people believe that this word should and should not be used. The people that think that this word should not be used believe that the word should be introduced because ""invasive"" is passing judgement,"" The people that think 'invasive' in for way that the invasive species unchecked by natural predators are a major threats to biodiversity."
10468	4	"The word ""invasive"" is significant because its not the right introduction the pythons deserve, its unfair. Even RobRoy MacInnes said that ""pythons is the best thing to happen to the Everglades in the last 200 years."
10470	4	"The word invasive can differentiate in the meaning in two ways. The word essentially means different. The article says, Biologists see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species. This is using the word in a bad way. The article also says, the term ""invasive species"" is unfair. This is the counter argument to say this word has a good meaning to it."
10471	4	The significance of the word invasive is to be un evasively like in the article, it talks about article in case, other   wise un avoidable because reptiles are every where in society now a days.
10472	4	MacInnes contends that the government overestimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles. He says he's being blocked by the U.S fish and wildlife service from importing some.
10474	4	People refer to the reptiles as invasive. They are judging something they know nothing about. ''Even the term ''invasive species'' is unfair he said. ''They're ''introduced.'' I think ''invasive'' is passing judgement.'' I got my idea out of this quote.
10476	4	Invasive means to be somewhere that it not suppose to be. Example the pythons dont belong in the everglades so it makes them an invasive species.
10478	4	"The word ""invasive"" used in the article means to not move or migrate or leave . The word  "" evade"" means to migrate or leave. Example of word ""invasive"" but biologist see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in this rising number of invasive species."""
10479	4	"The word ""invasive"" in the article means that the species is one that is not native to the area, and has no natural predators. As a result these invasive species will proliferate rapidly, and can land to the extinction of native species as well as a reduced bio-diversity for example, the pythons in Florida were considered invasive because they were not native, and had as natural predator."
10481	4	"The word ""invasive"" has significance to the rest of the article. This is because the word ""invasive"" is used to describe different species. Its says in the article that biologists see a ""riseing number of invasive species"". This is causing the reptiles to be in places they werent usally found befor and that is what most of the article is about so that is why is significant."
10483	4	Invasive has a lot to deal with this article because snakes and lizards are getting more popular so they would be very invasive.
10484	4	The word invasive means to enter without permission while the animals are not invasive because humans brought them here.
10485	4	"The term ""invasive"" is significant to the article. According to Skip Snow, a biologist, the pythons introduced to Florida are invasive, because they are spreading fast, even though they don't belong in Florida. Some think the term ""invasive"" is too harsh. MacInnes believes ""invasive"" is too harsh. He thinks ""introduced"" is more appropriate. It shows the differing attitudes of people to the situation in Florida."
10491	4	Invasive is a word used multiple times throughout the article. It first appears in paragraph 5, when the author writes about how invasive species consist of aligators, snakes, lizards and reptiles.
10492	4	The significance of the word invasive is extreme. Such as on page 5 '' a python swallowed an alligator.''
10494	4	The significance of the word invasive to rest of the article is that it shows how reptiles will eventually invade other parts of the U.S that es why invasive is significant to the article.
10495	4	The significance of the word invasive is quite potent in this article. Many biologists are concerned that pythons are becoming known as invasive spieces, unchecked are a major threat to biodiversity. MacInnes is very objective to this claim and fights to say the python was introduced.
10498	4	"The word invasive is referring to a time when the species doesn't reproduce for a little while. I think this because the article talked about a time when their is is ""log before prolifereting "" leading me to think that invasive is refferring to a type of lag period."
10499	4	"Throughout this artical the word invasive is used many times to discribe the python. This word is significant to the artical by making it very clear how the python population has taken over or ""invaded the everglades and now they will continue to flourish until something is done to control them."
10502	4	The reason invasive goes with the article is because the snakes are moving into this area and being invasive and not caring what the world before it and it will destroy the ecosystem if it not stoped.
10503	4	"The significance of the word invasive to the rest of this article is that invasive means that a type of species is breeding at a rate that is overpopulating the specialist example a type of python is an invasive type of species because there getting overpopulated. Evidence of this can be found in paragraph 5 where it says ""the rising number of invasive species, such as Burmese python which is breeding up a storm in Everglades."
10504	4	"I believe the word ""invasive"" means that they can go or adapt to any area that isn't that cold. What makes me believe this when it says ""But biologist see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species, such as the Burmese python, which is breeding up a storm in the Everglades, and the Nile monitor lizard a toothy carnivore that can reach seven feet in length and has found a happy home along the canal of cape coral."
10508	4	The word invasive is sugnifigant to the article because it describes how non-native creatures in an area can thrive and damage the delicate ecosystem such as pythons in the Everglades.
10510	4	The significant meaning of the word invasive is really unfair. According to MacInnes invasive means that its a passing judgement.
10513	4	"The significance of the word invasive is that species not found in that area inhabiting it and potetionlly messing up the eco-system. In the text it says, ""Unchecked natural predators, are a major threats to biodiversity."" (Achenbach 1). This shows how the imported reptiles are playing a massive role on native ecosystems they would not normal be located in."
10519	4	To me invasive means to move quickly or it means to something brand new.
10522	4	A species tendende to caver an enviornment and thrive off the minimal production. MacInnes sees it as an introduction.
10523	4	Invasive is significant because it shows that the species are not welcome by some as explained in the article.
10527	4	"The word ""invasive"" is very significant in the article. The word perfectly describes the pythons and what they are doing. The pythons invasion in certain places, like the Everglades is covering ""major increas in biodiversity."""
10529	4	"In this article they use the word invasive as a bad thing. I think it offends people who they call the python ""invasive species""."
10530	4	The word invasive is significant because thats what humans are doing to the world along with animals. We take over and take just like the python is doing in cape coral. They invade and multiply to make others.
10536	4	"The significance of the word invasive are that it means a group of species (animals) because invasive is kind like a bad word to animals like dangerous. It qutes that in the article it says ""I think that invasive is passing judgement."""
10537	4	The significance that the word invasive has throughout the article is that the article mostly talks about the more dangerous species of reptiles in the world and everything that can happen if they become loose in the wild.
10541	4	"The word ""invasive"" means that they pose a threat to animals that are less threatening. They are referred to as ""invasive"" because they are able to live in many parts of the world and are able destroy other species of animals. ""Mankind has chosen to make earth a rapid changing place. And that is what the rise of the reptiles are doing. So there should be no types of complaints."
10547	4	The word invasive means that the pythons species is invading human living and and trying to be top Dog. When people found the python eating the alligator one exploded.
10548	4	"The word invasive had a large impact on the article, especially when describing pythons. ""They're introduces. I think that invasive is passing judgement.. In the last 200 years."" This shows that the word invasive was thrown around to much and mainly believe the spread of pythons is a good thing."
10549	4	The word invasive is when something such as a python makes its way to where it is not native and starts to live and reproduce there. Such as in the map it shows how pythons have taken up most of the south of the US.
10550	4	The significance of the word invasive means untouchable. For example, snakes should be untouchable and a gift towards America, instead of looking at them in a bad way.
10551	4	The word invasive normally would mean something bad, but why would we use that to define our pets. There might be some difference between a dog and a snake but its what people like.
10552	4	The main idea of this article was about invasive species. Animals like python who can invade and diminish the natives are called the invasive species. The author is telling the readers what kind of harm can be done by the invasive species. Word invasive can be considered as the main idea of this article.
10554	4	"The word ""invasive"" is significant because in the article it is used in an unfair way to judge the reptiles says Mac Innes."
10555	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that to some people it can be their pets but to others its like an enemy or a threat of some sort that they dont like."
10566	4	The significance of the word invasive is to show that these animals are dangerous and cannot be trusted.
10569	4	Invasive is relevant to the rest of the article because it describes how species like the python have come into Florida and are now threating 5 endangered species like the key largo wood rat.
10571	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive' to the rest of the article is to let the reader know that reptiles such as the python are dangerous to try to avoid them."
10573	4	"The word ""invasive"" is used when being talked about environments + animals for example, pythons have been introduced to the everglades in the past 200 years. This is because pythons were invasive in mat environment adapted there ""organisms evolve in such environments so when barriers are broken down animals become invasive, complications arise."
10575	4	"I dont even know what ""invasive"" means."
10577	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is it implies that the species of animals that are being called invasive are taking over on purpose were they're really not being well secured in their pens, or they are being abandoned."
10578	4	''Invasive,'' is an important word in this story because it has an extremely negative connotation. When an animal is described as invasive, it implies that ''no one is in control,'' and like Burmese pythons in the Everglades., no one can really stop the spread of the creatures. Also, invasive implies it is killing native species like Everglades pythons are killing Key Largo wood rats.
10580	4	The significance of the word invasive is it means animals from around the world are invading other places because technology can replceage ones native environment. People are also demanding these invasive species as pegs.
10582	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that it means how the reptiles have rapidly spread to new parts of the country, almost like an invasion."
10583	4	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of the article because the article is mainly about dangerous animals. These animals can be described as invasive since they have been known to be harmful. One animal mentioned in the article is a python. Also in the article it states ""a python swallowed an alligator."" This is very invasive behavior."
10584	4	"The word ""invasive"" is making it sound like the snakes are taking over the US, but really they are just finding new homes."
10588	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is the debate that these reptiles kept as pet are invading the outside environment. When these invasive species go on living and not being checked on it causes threats to biodiversity. It suggests that there is a blending of organisms from all around the world and there is a chance it could turn crazy.
10591	4	To me, I think the word invasive means unexpected repopulation of another species. For example in the article it says ''invasive species unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity. This supports the idea of what invasive means because if animals that are invasive are not maintained in a certain amount that type of animal or species could have a wide spread which means there will be a lot more of them.
10592	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that it is showing how a majority of people see this increase of non-native reptiles as an un-wanted invasion. Just line in the article it says, ""But biologists see the trade in non native creatures as a factor in rising number of invasive species. The main idea of the article is whether or not if these non native species are an ""introduction"" or ""invasion""."
10593	4	Invasive would mean something that could invade places. Like how the python spread through out the Everglades in Florida from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Many people think that this might be true. But when the snakes were let loose the started multiplying and ending in a lot of places. They were including other habitats and even peoples homes.
10595	4	The very word here is invasive. The
10596	4	Invasive means introductive, where in this article they are talking about the pythons. The term invasive in this article symbolizes the python population growing, and being introduced to more places, people, and habitat.
10597	4	When they say the python and reptiles are being invasive that is because they think they are dangerous and harmful. The animals are just moving somewhere else for needs like humans move for need. They aren't being invasive they are just moving where there needs are.
10598	4	Invasive is what the entire article is pretty much talk the about.
10608	4	"I think in the article the word ""invasive"" means like out of the ordinary animals. Like reptiles, snakes basically animals not considered pets. In the article they keep using ""invasive species"" which to me they are refering to exocitic pets."
10612	4	Invasive means there either eating other animals or eating other animals food and habitat.
10614	4	Invasive is a word that means to adapt or to a just to like how a python can adjust to some of America after living in the rainforest for many years.
10615	4	Throughout the passage, snakes and other reptiles are referred to as invasive referring that they are a threat. MacInnes disagrees with the use of the term invasive as he feels reptiles are the introduction of a new species as approach to a species that will negatively affect biodiversity.
10616	4	"The word ""invasive"" is significant in this article because it suggests that the species are going to places of their own free will; places where they aren't wanted. A more positive description of the species as shown by MacInnes, is that they are ""introduced"" rather than invading. Meaning that people want the new animals their and this have then brought over as pets."
10619	4	The author thinks that the snakes are not invasive species , He think that they are being introduced. So I think invasive means to bring an animal to a new habitat for the wrong reasons.
10621	4	"The word ""invasive"" is important because it explains what a python could be. At times a python could be quite and minding its own business but there is always a huge threat that could attack and kill someone."
10622	4	The word invasive home means strong. Big and important. I think this word means that to be being thats how it sounds.
10630	4	The word invasive is significant to the article because no one seems to know how all different types of reptiles are starting to show up across the U.S.
10632	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article  a lot of people think the term invasive means dangerous. In the article one man's pet. Another's invasive species it shows the term ""invasive"" doesn't mean dangerous by saying in paragraph 7 "" Even the term ""invasive species is unfair, he said. They're introduced. I think that invasive is passing judgement."" That's what I think of the word invasive."
10633	4	"MacInnes does not think invasive species is an an apropriate term for animals that are ""introduced"" into new places. Snow has an oposite view of invasive species. He thinks that these species are harmful because they threaten native species. McInnes thinks that invasive species are good, because they are not invading, they are being introduceded. The article is about the difference in opinion of the term ""invasive""."
10643	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the article is to describe how many species of reptiles have been migrating all over. For example, ""by 2002, pythons were seen in multiple locations in remote regions of the Everglades."
10644	4	"By ""Invasive"" the author means the animals a prove to threat but have great instincts when a treat turns into an attacker."
10649	4	The significance of the word invasive is that they state that people around the world find the python and other animals that fit in the invasive species to be harmful to our environment and might cause extinction of animals around certain areas of the United States.
10651	4	"Even the term ""ivansive species"" is underfair. I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement."
10656	4	Our would is being invated by snakes and other killer pets. People get eaten by both constricters and other snakes but people still have them as pets.
10658	4	"I think the word Invasive means that it should be against the law or you would need to own a permit to have one of these animals. MaInnes even said the term ""Invasive species"" is unfair. It was said that it was the best thing to happen in the everglades in the last 200 yrs."
10659	4	It is important to know what invasive is because the article is explaining the threats of certain invasive species are entering our country, is without knowing an invasive species is you can't understand the article.
10661	4	Invasive is significant word because it illustrates how secretly introduced species are vewed by many. Pythons readly escaped into the wild in Florida and are widely considered intruders even though it was humans who initially brought them in.The word is important mostly because of the blame it costs.
10662	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" meaning invading.In this case ar own of python population. In the text it states"" many invasive species under go a log before proliferating."
10663	4	"The word invasive means"" to invade"". I believe it's significant to the story in the aspect that animals like the python sort of invadat the U.S. The article states they believe Hurricane, Andrew helped out with this because it destructed many homes & it probably released the pythons and resulted in an ""invasion"" from pythons."
10672	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is it means the animal is lethal and potential threat to othe species of animals.
10673	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest oft he article is how people have been taking in reptiles, snakes and lizards,. They are neat in the wild not the house or a cage.
10676	4	The importance of the word invasive is correctly saying that it's a animal of something that might soreant.
10681	4	"The significance of the word invasive is that biology are calling  specie4s such as pythons and lizard and other reptile, invasive species ""because they are not native to our country is also significant because MacInnes thinks these species are not invasive,but ""introdused""saying calving them invasive is passing judgement."
10683	4	The word invasive means that there's a lot of those animals all around the earth. For example, in the article map shows that pythons are almost all over United States.
10685	4	I think invasive is to to tell the animals to calm their selves and potential python, wildlife. For every rides, inheriting five endangered species.
10686	4	"Invasive is significant in this article because it discusses how these pythons are an invasive species because they are ""unchecked by natural predators"" & ""are major threats to biodiversity"" in the United States."
10687	4	Invasive is pretty much showing that the python could live any where as long the climate conditions similar to those in their Asian homeland.
10692	4	"The significance of the word ""Invasive"", is more like the term of invasion, to be altensive uninvited or unexpectedly, as stated in the story ""...were seen in multiple locations in remote regions of the Everglades."""
10696	4	"The word ""invasive"" sets of the conflict of this articoul. While some individuals like Skip Snow (wildlife biologist) belive that the ""invasive"" species are just that others such as RobRoy MacInnes is devoted to his belife that these animals dont ""invade"" but were introduced here."
10699	4	"Invasive is a significant word because in the  article it says ""Invasive species is unfair. Invasive is considered a passing judgement"". This shows importance because it shows how invasive shouldn't be the term used to show how pythons. Invasive species has major threats to biodiversity."
10704	4	"Invasive means to be unknown in the article it says ""even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said. ""They're introduced"" I think that 'invasive' is a passing judgement. This is why I think invasive means unknown."
10705	4	The simple word invasive plays a big role in this story. The word means dangerous, capable of doing harm to something or someone. This is a debate to be held as pets. The right precautions are being made like the microchip.
10706	4	The word ''invasive'' basically means over invading a space. So the snakes weren't being invasive, they were jus migrating.
10710	4	"The word invasive in this article is generally reffering to species in which are living in places they do not belong. The article says that invasive speices are ""major threat to biodiversity"". this is important because if one speicies is introduced in a place and doesn't belong it could harm its natural habitat."
10719	4	"The significance for the word ""Invasive"" Explains the species is increasing."
10720	4	"In the story the word ""Invasive"" means animals that came from other places and spread in a new place."
10723	4	"The word ""invasive"" is very important in this article because all the reptiles and coming and replacing regular house hold pets."
10729	4	"This article talks a lot about invasive species, but really these species aren't invasive. The article talks about how they were brought here. Paragraph 7 says ""the term invasive isn't fair. They're introduced to us. I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement""."
10730	4	Invasive is a very strong word. It is important because when you call animals such as the python that it is implying that they are the bad guys when having pythons in Florida might not be such a bad thing.
10731	4	In the article, the word invasive implies that species such as pythons are invading habitats, such as the Everglades. The word invasive implies that the pythons are''taking over'' the Everglades, and causing harm to the original inhabitants. By using the word invasive to describe the pythons in the Everglades, the author describes pythons as unwelcome intruders, jepordizing the security of native species.
10735	4	"The word ""invasive"" could mean many things to people but to me it means someone experaments with animals invetting them."
10736	4	The significance of the word invasive is to show it is a threat to the other species around and how it can invade an area for its own good at the expense of others.
10737	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is used to mean like a wild species, which I got from the title of the article ""one man's pet, Anothers invasive species""."
10738	4	"The word invasive in this article is the same as to introduce animals that are invasive aren't native to the area ""invasive species unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodivesity."" This invasive is to introduce a animals to a land that wasn't already there."
10739	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the actual means to the article and smass that people are passing judgement on these animals with out even running what they are capable of for example quote from the article is""invasive species, its unfair. Thafre introduced i think the invasive is passing judgment "". This quote show an example on how the assume things about these animal with out knowledge trict when is unfair."
10740	4	I think the word invasive means dangerous animals that don't belong in the US. In the article it tells about invasive animals such as the Burmese pythons and the Nile monitor Lizard.
10743	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that these reptiles are invading our space, they are breeding and growing rapidly. ""But biologist... invasive species, such as the Bumese pythons which is breeding up a storm"". They are growing to fast for humans to control."
10744	4	The significance of the word ''invasive'' to this article is '' the rising number of invasive species, such as the Burmese python which is breeding up a storm in the Everglades.'' Also from the article ''however, say that invasive species, unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity.'' This word ''invasive'' is very important to species.
10748	4	The significance of the word invasive is a species that have a major threat to their environment. The predators move around and catch more prey and it effects the other environments around them.
10749	4	The significance of the word invasive is its not such a good thing. According to the article its unfair. Meaning that is a bad judgement of these animals.
10751	4	Invasive means something that is new to an area. When they were saying that pythons were invasive to an area in Florida it just meant that they were new and needed to adapt to the new conditions, food, and living space.
10752	4	"To MacInnes the word ""Invasive"" is an unfair term. I think that it makes the animals sound woree than what they realy are and that maybe anoter word that dosent arise the animal an image would be better. For people to see how they realy are and understand their ways."
10754	4	The word invasive signifies most of the species in this article,Boa's pythons,cobra's, these species formed in all other countries and the seller is bringing these species into the U.S and selling them house pets.
10755	4	"Invasive species are very significant and the word invasive describes any animal, like the python that, ""unchecked by natural predators is a major threat to biodiversity."
10756	4	"Invasive to me is when something is brought somewhere that doesn't belong."" Paragraph 7 it says the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said They were introduced. In the article the snakes are thought be be invasive but their not we humans brought them there."
10759	4	From the artical it looks like invasias is a good thing.
10760	4	"In this article, ""invasive"" means a species that will disturb ecodiversity and passing on ecosystem. ""the government overestimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles."
10762	4	"The word invasive means in the article that certain animals are moving into an area where they are unwanted such as the phytons. P.4""Biologists however say that invasive species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats."""
10763	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that animals that are from out of the US. Are dangerous to us people in the US because the animals don't have their same habitat.
10764	4	The significance to ths word is that it explains how the scientists really feel, but it isn't used once again throughout the whole article.
10765	4	The term invasive implies that the reptiles are a harmful thing to the communities that take them in as pets. According to the article, after the reptiles were introduced to the new environment they threatened other species, like the key largo wood rats.
10766	4	The significance of the word invasive to the article is it is used to describe same reptiles as not introduced. In other words invasive is used towards reptiles imported and not properly introduced.
10767	4	"In paragraph 7 say ""invasive is passing judgement""."
10773	4	Invasive is a term used for plants and animals that aren't native to a specific area, but have colonized and prospered in that area. The article discusses pythons, who are not native to Florida, but have prospered in that state, helping imperil five endangered species, after destruction in Hurricane Andrew released them into the wild.
10777	4	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of the story because it helps explain how the pythons have been ""introduced"" into the population they've invaded it. The article states that the pythons have been breeding up a storm and has exploded into the Everglade population. It is used to allow the reader understand what is going on in the population."
10780	4	"When the article says invasive it shows that the animals just go to the first place they find. ""The term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said, ""they're introduced. 'I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement""."
10783	4	The importance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is that it was used to descerbe any unusual pet. For example, RobRay MacInnes is the guy to see if you want to buy a crocodile (1).
10784	4	"The significant of the word ""invasive"" is that it's saying that reptiles are based invading Florida because of the growing popular demand in paragraph 7, it says the term ""invasive"" species"" is unfair, he said.They're introduced their saying that the species don't belong there."
10785	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to this article talks about how much invasive species can and can't be potentially harmful to an environment."
10787	4	When the author uses the word invasive. It shows importance relating to the reptiles.
10789	4	The word invasive is usually meant to describe something only moving into another habitat. This is the case of the python, it does not belong in this ecosystem and yet, its here and people are clearly breeding them.
10797	4	Invasive is a word they use to jude the animal which is a python and the reason they say that word is because its a animal that is dangerous and is spreading everywhere in the south climate region. When the natural barriers are removed they can go anywhere and then complications are ensure.
10799	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is when ""invasive"" species such as pythons migrate to other places places where people are expected to see them. They invade the area alarming people and they have to be directed by natural predators to reduce major threats to biodiversity."
10800	4	"The word invasive is significant to the article because it signifies that reptiles are entering areas where in theory wouldn't work. ""In 2003with the a change trail a reliable location for viewing wildlife were startled to see was alligator with a python in its mouth. ""This is an example of their generalist actions and know their invasive behavior disrupts other species."
10801	4	"I think by ""invasive"" this article refers to it as poorly and invading. In the article it says invasive species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity. What they are eluding to is that the animals that arent native here, are invading the biodiversity."
10804	4	In the article, invasive is proposed as dangerous species. The author is trying to say that pythons are dangerous when wild.
10809	4	"The word in Invasive can mean sneaked or what, invasive meaning in this paragraph. I say this because in paragraph 7 it says ""I think that invasive is passing judgement"". Then it paragraphs it says ""To me its a wonderful, introduction"".  This means that people think the creatures are not being specialist."
10811	4	"In the article ""invasive""  came with someone saying ""it's a wonderful introduction. I think it's the best thing to happen to the Everglades ..."" I think that throughout the article it showed that having pythons is a good thing."
10812	4	Ivasive means, ''even the term ''invasive species'' is unfair, he said. They're introduced, I think that ''invasive'' is passing judgment.
10819	4	Invasive relates to the article because it's what people first think of reptiles which takes them off guard.
10820	4	The term 'invasive' means to another piece of wild nature. Invasive has used as a wonderful introduction in the article for the pythons.
10821	4	"The word ""Invasive is evident to have significance to the article, because it is used multiple time to describe creatures."
10822	4	The word invasives is significant to the article because you never want one species taking over. In the article it says biologists however say that invasive species unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity. This means there snakes can change the enviorment eally fast which can be dangerous.
10823	4	"The signifigance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article to show what the author is trying to put empesis on. For example in paragraph seven, the author uses that word next to unfair. The snakes and reptiles were more introduced then unfair. The author also says that invasive is a passing judgement."
10829	4	Invasive means like dangerous animals such as some reptiles.
10832	4	The significance of the word invasive in this article is that these animals  populations are increasing extremely and most people believe that it can only cause danger. Biologist say that these natural predators are major threats to biodiversity. They also fear the outcome when they can spread anywhere.
10833	4	Invasive is significant because most people think its too harsh a word to use for reptiles, because people don't realize how cool they really are.
10835	4	"The word ""invasive"" means dangerous and some areas like in this article. The article describes species such as lizards to be less harmful than safe."
10836	4	Invasive is significant to this story because pandas, koalas and pythons are invasive.
10838	4	"Many call reptiles and amphibians ""invasive"" due to their primary assumptions. The article says that many snakes, such as the Burmese pythons, are increasing and ""invading our planet"" if many realize that they are not harmless, invasive would not be used to describe them."
10839	4	"The word ""invasive"" is used to describe a species that tends to order a new ecosystem and break homes once it invades because of the lack of natural barriers or predators."
10844	4	The word invasive implies that a species is invading an area. Such as the python is doing in the Southern State of the U.S.
10847	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that in this article the author says, ""Biologists...say that invasive unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."" The invasive aspect relates to numerous species of foreign reptiles and lizards being introduced."
10848	4	The word invasive,comes from the word invade. It means when something or someones takes over something or some place. For example, in the article, it speaks about how pythons are invading the Everglades and have spread almost everywhere in the southern united states. The pythons are invading other animals habitats.
10849	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that the article is  talking about how these reptiles are moving from there habitat, a factor in the rising number of invasive species, such as the Everglades."""
10850	4	"The word invasive is significance to the article because in the article it says the animals are invasive and is a threat to us, but invasive is not the right word since they don't coma here to cause any harm, and their not trying to takeover. ""Even the term invasive species is unfair"""" said Mac Innes."
10851	4	Invasive is an important word in the article because the word invasive only really comes up when the intrudes is unwanted. I don't like snakes so if I found one in my room I would call it an intruder as appropriate. If I found a puppy in my room we would be introduced.
10852	4	The significance of the word invasive is very important because all the story talks about is invasive animals that are being taken out of their habitats and put into new ones which changes a lot.
10853	4	"Invasive species are species like pythons that invade a place where they are not wanted in don't belong there. For example in article 12 ""Many invasive species undergo a lag before poliforating."""
10854	4	Well the term invasive means invade. It is significant to the rest of the article because the whole article is about invasive species like the python. Also the title of the article in are tried put another's invasive species.
10857	4	The word invasive I'm assuming means to invade or something invading that these reptiles doesn't belong. The story pretty much states that these reptiles don't belong in Florida and they're out of their place.
10858	4	The word ''invasive'' is used a lot in this article. It is used to describe species like pythons who are introduced to a new environment then fruitfully multiply. As stated in the article, pythons are abundant in the Everglades which is not their natural habitat. This is why the python is considered invasive.
10865	4	"According to paragraph 7, they explaind how ""the term invasive species is unfair and how they are & ""introduced,"" invasive seems to mean invading according to that paragraph and the rest of the article. This is because the way they talk about pythons sounds as if they were expeding how pythons are overpopulating and invading the south of the U.S."
10866	4	"The word ""invasive"" is very significant to the article. RobRoy  MacInnes opinion of the word ""is unfair"" and that the word ""is passing judgement."" Maybe we as humans are being invasive disturbing ""the natural barriers"" of the animals."
10868	4	The word invasive is important to the article because it informs the reader that not only is the a species not native, but it is taking over its new enviroment.
10869	4	"""Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair."" The significance is big because it labels the animal as something bad which gives you a second thought about these animals. I don't think it is unfair because animals like snakes are very dangerous."
10871	4	"The significant of the word ""invasive"" means passing judgement in paragraph 7 it says "" invasive is a passing judgement""."
10872	4	Looking for danger finding, hungry and.
10873	4	The significance of the word invasive is that its use to describe the animals as univoal specios to have as pet. It makes the article more interesting because its stating that these animals are scary and, dangerous and can be harmful if not checked by progresonals.
10877	4	"Word ""Invasive"" is one of the word that is important among three articles in the first, the author introduced reptile pets that are not native as ""invesive"", since they break the dioversity. Also in second article, the 'invasive' species are now expanding throughout countores which can threat native animals too. This ties up with the idea of generalist and specialist on third article, because now days, the 'invasive' animals are beomg generalists, which can live better."
10878	4	"The word ""invasive"" means that species that aren't unchecked by natural predators, and people think that they are major threats to biodiversity because a lot of people don't really care about the python species and MacInnes stated that the term 'invasive species' is just a passing judgement people like to make."
10881	4	"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" to the article is strongly used and supported because the only people attempting to take care of these reptiles don't have enough support or help around them to save or find the endangered reptiles that run freely around there habitat."
10884	4	The significance to the word invasive is that the article is talking about how they don't know how the population of the snakes have become large, but they are taking over the Everglades.
10885	4	Invasive means different from others. In the article they talk about reptiles and how they are different from a caddy pet you keep at home and that reptiles should be treated with the same respect.
10890	4	The word invasive meaning dangerous, not safe sneaky. Its really courageous and outgoing to have a wild life animal as an house pet. Animals of that sort need to adapt to there natural habitat.
10894	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that the article is based on the reptiles that can be harmful. Most people think that these animals are no good based on judgement. While other people feel they can be pets. Maybe people shouldn't be so judgemental.
10896	4	"The word ""invasive"" is used to describe how dangerous pythons are. In the article, RobRoy MacInnes argues that this term is overestimated by our government and this is ""unfair'. This term is significant to the rest of the article because this article explains that while same pythons are dangerous, they should be introduced to our environment and adapt."
10897	4	The significance of the word invasive to the article is because imported exotic animals that are dangerous such as the Pakistan black cobra and other reptiles are being sold to households all across the southern states in the U.S.
10899	4	"The word ""invasive"" signifies the reptiles because the author is trying to reveal to the readers that this issue is somewhat important. The author is trying to show that the ""invasive species"" are not really favored by a lot of people. ""Invasive species is unfair, he said they're 'introduced. I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement."" (Achen bach 4)"
10901	4	"The significance of the word invasive is that it tells how some animals can adapt to other places that ""they're introduced"" (4), the entire article talks about how pythons like change and so what better way to change than to introduce them to a new environment. The significance of the word is to show how the earth is a ""rapidly changing place"".(5)"
10902	4	The word invasive has a large significance to the article. It illustrates that pythons are a threat to the everglades. The word shows that the pythons have no natural predators in Florida, and will take over, lowering biodiversity the word indicates they are not desired.
10904	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that people are saying that the pythons are invading the everglades. But malines thinks other wise, he says it's the best thing to happen to the everglades in the past 200 years. Biologists, say, however invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity.
10908	4	"The word ""Invasive"" is important to the article in order to explain certain species and determine how they can affect population of other animals. It is explained in the article that invasive species may cause danger to native species. In paragraph 11, the author explains how the native key largo wood rat a native species, got swallowed by an invasive python."
10909	4	"The word invasive has a significance in this article because it does seem as if the pythons can ""invade"" on different environments. If they are to end up in the US they could cause a serious shift in the environment. Causing many species to become extinct because they invaded their environment."
10910	4	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that invasive animals are generalists, who can invade states or countries where they normally wouldn't live. Invasive animals can do a lot of harm to native animals.
10913	4	"The word ""invasive"" means is a passing judgment , ""invasive species"". They're indiodired"" unchecked by natural predator are major threats to biodiversity."
10914	4	Invasive is the guiding word throughout the whole story. This word shows the differences of opinion amongst many people. Many Bioligists believe that invasive species like the python are a harm to the enviorment. MacInnes doesn't even think of the python as an invasive species, but more of an introduced species.
10915	4	The significance of the word invasive is that all of the creatures they talked about in this story are invasive.
10916	4	The word invasive means invading. If animals are invasive it means they are in the way or in other animals space.
10918	4	The significance of the word invasive is to say that there are many different species who can be very dangerous and some could be not so dangerous according to.
10921	4	"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" is that it talks about animals people hardly see. In paragraph 7, MacInnes said that, ""even the term "" Invasive species"" is unfair. "" They're introduced"". So in conclusion, ""Invasive"" is another way of saying introduced."
10922	4	Invasive means like invaded so the significance of this article is that you shouldn't invade the animals habitat.
10926	4	"Invasive is important to the article because the story is about ""invasive"" species, like pythons, in America. Some people disagree with invasive however ""even the term invasive species is unfair, he said, 'they're introduced'. I think that invasive is passing judgement""(Achenbach11)."
10927	4	"""Invasive"" means they invade. In this case their saying that the species/reptiles are invading and goinging into others territory."
10929	4	Invasive is meaning that they are not naturally living here, they were introduced by something and in this case, it was humans. The invasive species cause threats to the environment because they have no natural predator so they can reproduce rapidly with out being harmed.
10930	4	Invasive is signifinant to the rest of the article because its a wonderful introduction.They believe its the best thing to happen to the everglades.
10933	4	"The signifigance of the word invasive I think is that, just by hearing the word sounds bad or dangerous and in the article it stated paragraph 7. ""Even the term"" invasive species ""is unfair."" It also said that the word invasive is a ""passing judgement."""
10934	4	invasive basically means harmful to society of it wouldn't be good for the species itself. Like a python living in the cold, he would die.
10937	4	"The word ""invasive"" essentially means being relocated to a new habitat. ""Invasive"" is significant to the rest of the article because the python is an invasive animal since it did not travel by itself from Asia, it was brought over by humans and was forced to adapt."
10939	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" it means like streaching like the python habitat stretching from California to Delaware and including much of the south."
10940	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is that MacInnes is a seller of invasive animals but he says even the term invasive speicies is unfair he also states ""They're introduced."""
10941	4	I think the word invasive means something good something unique. These animals aresomething special and can do things that we can not. People have to home these reptiles in there house holds 9.8 million house holds contan atlesalt one reptile.
10942	4	Invasive is that their an aware, pythons an invasive to certain areas a trying into new locations and found ways.
10943	4	"Invasive means to judge for example in the article it seye ""invasive species, thats unfair."""
10944	4	The word invasive was used to describe the python in paragraph (5) the word was used to show how the python was invading climates that it was never intended to be in and it is causing major trouble's in these climates because there are no predators to eat there.
10945	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that some animals are going into Lands where they shouldn't be. They are being imported to other land."
10946	4	Invasive is a keyword in the article because it is a word used to describe certain reptiles. The word has a negative connotation to it implying overpopulation. The population of reptiles is spreading as a result of people keeping them as pets. This is causing problems in Florida, as strange things are now happening with these animals. For example alligators and pythons who have likely become invasive began eating each other. Thes are too many of them to survive.
10948	4	"I think the word invasive is passing judgement. Also the word is the introduced you to everything. Someone stated ""To me, it's a wonderful introduction. I think it's the best thing to happen to the Everglades in the last 200 years."""
10949	4	The word vasive means animals that have not been unchecked by natural preadtors means to the rest of the world that most other animals around the world that we don't know about.
10950	4	"The word ""invasive"" is used numerous times in the article and is significant. It is significant because while soltes believe these different species are ""invasive"" others such as MacInnes feel the term is passing judgement. The term ""invasive"" is important because it can help determine point of view within the article."
10952	4	The word invasive is an animal that is overestimated to be a threat. Such as a snake, lizard, or other reptiles.
10954	4	The word invasive signifies the growing threat of foreign animals multiplying in places thy aren't normally found. It also describes how harmful they are to the native species of that area.
10957	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is almost unique. The context in which the word is used shows that the word means different or unique. The ""invasive species"" mentioned in the article are reptiles, which are very unique creatures and would make a unique pet."
10958	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is that these reptiles are becoming more popular in U.S. homes as pets. About 4.8 million homes have a reptile as a pet."
10959	4	Invasive is when a species not normally in a certain place or environment become abundant there. The Burmese pythons are intrusive to Florida, as they are not native to that place. They are also causing the extinction of they Key largo wood rat.
10964	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is invasive species people almost think that these animals are bad and very harmful."
10965	4	The word insaive is used significantly because pythons move around and adapt to other environments. The article says ''organisms move around other enviornments but not this fast.''
10966	4	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the article is to show how they are calling these animals."

13365	5	The first step involved in protein synthesis is when the mRNA unzips the DNA strand. Secondly, each nucleotide, (adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine), is paired with another nucleotide. Adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine with cytosine. Lastly, as the mRNA pairs the nucleotide bases, two new DNA strands are formed.
13366	5	The mRNA will first take protien to the nucleus. Then it will send it to the tRNA. The tRNA trasport will then send it to the body.
13367	5	The mRNA bonds with an amino acid and they form a new sequence of DNA. The mRNA then releases and brings the new sequence back to be analyzed. These processes are known as transcription.

13389	5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it gets matched up with its pair. once they have both strands they creat codons. codons are involved in protein synthesis.
13390	5	you need it to live
13391	5	mRNA is sent to a ribosome where there it is made into tRNA.  the tRNA the goes to the decodons where it is split into triplets where it can be read to be made into amino acids. the amino acids then can know what cells to make and what they do.
13392	5	The mRNA is going to send the message of the codon, then the tRNA will take place and that will translate the RNA into an amino acid. Fianlly then the amino acid is made.

13419	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and separates.  New bases match up with the separated bases, also known as translation.  The new strand of tRNA codes for a protein, which results in a protein chain forming with one protein for every three bases, until the chain is coded to stop.
13420	5	mRNA is translated to tRNA then the ribosomes make the protiens.
13421	5	once mRNA leaves the protein synthesis can begin
13422	5	The four steps in protein synthesis are when they begin to be made, then specialized, moved off then the protein perform certain jobs.
13423	5	It goes to the tRNA and lists the thingy. tRNA takes it and develops it into an another strand.
13424	5	When mRNA leaves .Something else has to come in and replace it..It has to make new ones..It has to fight harder becuase of the missing mRNA.They can build a new structure.
13425	5	The mRNA attaches to a ribosome or rRNA. Then the first anticodon, or tRNA, matches up with the start codon. Then an amino acid attatches to the tRNA. This process repeats itself until there are three amino acids linked together to form a protein.
13426	5	DNA is the one thing you need in this.RNA is another one you could use all the time.MPT could be one to use to help with one that can't do it.PTM is the one they use alot and they help with it all.

13446	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus. The first step is that it enters the cell membrane, then to the cell wall, and then back to the nucleus.
13447	5	After leaving the nucleus the mRNA it connects to a ribosome, then the ribosome reads the DNA and sends it to a RNA strand and then it is sent into the cell membrane.
13448	5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are mRNA which is messenger RNA, tRNA which is transfer RNA, and then rRNA whichis ribosomal RNA. mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein.  Transfer RNA transfers the proteins to the mitochondria.  Ribosomal RNA has to do with ribosomes.
13449	5	mRNA, tRNA, gRNA, rRNA
13450	5	During protein synthesis an mRNA molecule binds with a tRNA molecule that way it can be transported. After this it will go to the Endoplasmic Reticulum where protein synthesis takes place. Here it will be uncoded by nucleotides, then it will be arranged the way it is supposed to be arranged, and put back together.
13451	5	Transcription happens which means the mRNA copies the DNA codes. Translation happens at the Ribosomes which makes the protiens. The rRna makes the ribosomes.
13452	5	Anaphase, interphase, metaphase, and prophase. These phases are major steps in protein synthesis.
13453	5	The internal structure of the mitochondria serves to maximize cellular reproduction.
13454	5	they send the information to the DNA, the genes and traits are converted to the information the cell can use
13455	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the steps in protein synthesis are:1. Anaphase2. Metaphase3. Telophase
13456	5	tRNA takes a segment of the sequence to the RNA.RNA makes the first strand of the DNA.a complimentary strand is made.it reaches the stop codon.
13457	5	1. mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein.2. The amino acids receive the instructions from the mRNA and begin to form polypeptide chains.3. The polypeptide chains form in the coded form of amino acids given from the mRNA.4. Proteins are formed from the polypeptide sequences.
13458	5	1.mRNA leaves the nucleus2.makes a new mRNA3.divides4. mutation accurs
13459	5	mRNA leaving first makes a copy of the DNA and the RNA
13460	5	The mRNA enters the ribosome,THE ribosome reads the codons,tRNA brings Amino acids to the ribosome, forms chain of Amino acids.
13461	5	New codons attaching to the Dna strand.
13462	5	Protein synthesis is part of your body system somthing you have too have too keep you from getting sick all the time .
13463	5	Unzipping and unwinding the DnaTransfering over to the cytoplasm of the cell.Attaching to an amino acid.Moving through the cell
13464	5	After it leaves the cell it then ataches to a DNA strand.  Then a protein strand ataches to it giving it protein.  After this the mRNA realeses from the DNA then it is a protein strand and it is used in other parts of the body.
13465	5	leaving the nucleusstoping to get some protinesstoping at the mitocondrathe ending out side the cell
13466	5	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are amino acids, phosphate groups, nitogenous bases, and sugars.
13467	5	make the protienmultiplydividetransfer the protiens
13468	5	The mRNA connects to the RNA after that the protein begines to form from the mRNA.
13469	5	its the messaging system, it takes out what needs to be out.it gathers information that you might need.then it goes to rRNA which  is where the ribosomes make the protiens, then tRNA, which then is where you transfer all of it in the body.
13470	5	The DNA strand separates in 2. Then it is known as RNA. Next the strand of DNA is copied as the original strand of DNA, and the RNA is copied to make protiens.
13471	5	Photosynthesis takes in sun and converts it into energy
13472	5	metamorphis,anaphase,telephaseprophase
13473	5	it leaves goes to the trna which the trna transfers it which it then sends it to the rrna which decodes it
13474	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm.There the tRNA has ribosomes attach to it. The tRNA then goes into the mitochondria where rRNA makes proteins that the cell needs.
13475	5	The mRNA goes to the ribosomes which make the proteins and then the ribosomes make the certain type of protein needed.
13476	5	transfer message rRNA gRNA
13477	5	First the mRNA moves leaves the nucleus and changes into a tRNA then the tRNA attaches a amino acid to its self. From there the tRNA lines up its sequences with the unzipped DNA. Leaving behind its amino acid, they start to create a strand of amino acids, known as a protien.
13478	5	The mRNA carries the imformation to the amino acids.The information in the mRNA helps build the proteins and stuctures.The amino acids and codons help make new cells and proteins. The
13479	5	rRNA must replicate the RNA sequence. The mRNA must deliver the sequence to the DNA. The tRNA transfers the protein to the DNA sequence. The gRNA is the final step.
13480	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the four major steps involved in protein syntheis are going to the golgi apparatus, dropping off protein, which then goes to the lysosomes, next being dropped off on mitochondria, and last being recived by the cell.
13481	5	1. Transfering to the ribosomes.2. The ribosomes making the proteins.3. tRNA moving protein throughout the cell.4. Starts back at the nucleus.
13482	5	One step would be cell diffusion,when a cell connectes to another form a hydrogen bond.The secound  step would be when the mRNA fuses the two cells together.The third step is when the hydrogen bonds leaves.The forth step is when the mRNA leaves that cell and moves down the line to the next cell.
13483	5	-an enzyme breaks appart a strand of rna-an enzymes goes through reading and matching them with the correct matchs creating a codon-the codon is read and produces an amino acid-the amino acids attach and creat a protein chain
13484	5	the mRNA sends the protein to the tRNA, 'encrypt' the codon, release the codon, and the codon goes to the nucleius
13485	5	prophase,metephase,anaphase,morphaseThrough out these procceses they slipt an make a new cell.
13486	5	Goes to make protiens.
13487	5	the mRNA leaves the nucleus then i goes to another cell and it kind of sends a message to the cell and it makes it own copy of what the mRNA brought over
13488	5	Messenger RNA leaves the nucleus and carries amino acids to transfer RNAThe tRNA hooks on to the amino acids and puts them in pairs of three to form protein.RNA polymerase goes down the rows of proteins and checks for errors.The proteins are then coded from RNA to DNA and bonded together by hydrogen bonds.
13489	5	The first major step would be to take the mRNA to tRNA so the tRna can translate the DNA's strands. From there the tRNA will go to the rRNA. Third it will pass the information to the mRNA. Then finally the RNA will be finished and a new strand will be made.
13490	5	proteins provide energy for the cell so it can do all of its duties.
13491	5	The mRNA meets up with the DNA and connects with the codons.
13492	5	the trna as tranlated< then it is transfered> finds the match>and brings it back
13493	5	it helps the body fight viruses.it also helps the body wit you red blood cells.keeps the body energized.and helps the body strangth.
13494	5	The mRNA leaves then it trys to go to where it needs to go once it gets to the place it send the information to the brain and then the brain tells the body what to do.
13495	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus then it transforms into tRNA. It changes so that the tRNA can move from inside the cell to the outside. The tRNA then splits in half to create two half strands of DNA. The half strands then pick up stray amino acids that match up with the corresponding amino on the DNA. 'A' matches with 'u' and 'c' matches with 'g'.
13496	5	The mRNA, or messenger RNA, is sent out through a nuclear pore in the nucleus. It then travels around in the cytoplasm, and settles somewhere within it. It then sits around and waits, and then when a ribosome comes around, it hooks itself on to the mRNA. The mRNA then sends instructions to the ribosome, and together they start making proteins in protein synthesis.
13497	5	1. the mRNA goes out of the nucleus2. the mRNA splits in two3. the two strands create a matching side for itself4. the mRNA create organs in the bodythe end.

13501	5	WHEN THE tRNA LEVES THE RANA TO GO TO THE DNA
13502	5	The four major steps are when it enter the cell, it goes threw the process, it began it help the nucules and then it is synthesis.
13503	5	1. tRna attaches to mRna.2. Codons attach with anticodons.3. A polypeptide chain forms.4. Proteins are created.
13504	5	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are after mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribosomes, telling the ribosomes the different proteins in the nucleus. Then, the mRNA is beginning to copy itslef. After that you have two forms of mRNA that now contain proteins. Proteins are made in the ribosomes and lastly you have your proteins that become attached the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
13505	5	It starts with RNA and leads to protein synthesis.
13506	5	1. the mRNA leaves the Nucleus after corying the DNA code2. The mRNA takes the code to the Ribosome.3. In the ribosome the tRNA trransfers the code into codons.4. then matches are found for the codon and put together starting with a start codon and ending in a stp codon, to result in a protein.
13507	5	Four things that involve in protein synthetics is carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. also sometimes sulfer.
13508	5	mRNA is in the nucleusmRNA writes a message tRNA takes it to the cell membrane rRNA decodes the message
13509	5	there r 4 steps
13510	5	mRNAmeosis
13511	5	Transcription,translation,messnger rna, and respiration.Transcription copies what needs to be copied. Translation removes what needs to be removed. Messenger rna sends what message needs to be sent. Respiration helps clear out any germs.
13512	5	1.mRNA leaves the nucleus2.It teams up with other cells3.The cells carry out there jobs4.they form there protein
13513	5	It receives, sends, takes back, and gives off.
13514	5	The mRNA travels to a ribosome.The tRNA attaches to the mRNA and matches up bases in a process known as translation.Then, the tRNA brings these codes and matches them with amino acids. These amino acids are then put together and form a protein.
13515	5	1.) The two singled stranded DNA's are cut in half.2.)One of the single stranded DNA's would exit the nucleus.3.) The mRNA would connect with a peptide bond.4.) The mRNA that is connectied by a peptide bond would connect with more to creat a protein.
13516	5	sends a message
13517	5	tRNA enters comes and attaches itself to the mRNA and creates amino acids to give to the rRNA to give to the ribosomes which then makes into protiens that get transported to the golgi apperatice that synthesizes the protiens.
13518	5	mRna leaves the nucleus. Then goes through to transfer its mrna with trnaThen it turns into a tRNAIt then transfer the rna through the protein.
13519	5	interphase, anaphase, metaphase, prophase
13520	5	getting nutrients,drinking milk
13521	5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then attachs to the DNA, then the DNA unzips, then the protein detaches and then you have protein synthesis.
13522	5	MRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to tRNA and tRNA sends whatever message mRNA gives it to a cell in the body.  This is how mRNA gets messages to other parts of the body.
13523	5	1. anaphase2. interphase3. metaphase4. prophase
13524	5	Protein synthesis has 5 major steps involved. The first one is the mRNA leaving the nucleus. mRna is considered the 'messenger.' mRNA carries instructions for the amino acid sequence that is shown in a protein. Once the information gets to where it is needed, the cell uses it to make a protein.
13525	5	mRNA goes out into the cytoplasm and into the ribosomes to the nucleus to the nucleolous
13526	5	the mRNA matches up with the RNA and creates proteins.
13527	5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are traveling to the nucleolous, ribosomes are developed, The mRNA travels to the nucleolous to give it intructions to make a ribosome.
13528	5	mRNA-send a massiage to the nuclusaying that it is time to divide.rRNAtRNA-transfers the DNA to the new cell.
13529	5	As the mRNA leaves through the pores of the nucleus it travels to the ribosomes or amino acids. At the ribosomes the mRNA puts the protein anf information. After the ribosomes or amino acids have that the information is evenly distributed and the cell begins to split. The cell then is pinched in the middle to make two new cells.
13530	5	mRNAleaves the nucleus.tRNA transports. rRNA produces ribosomes.
13531	5	1.help your muscles 2.keeps you from getan sick
13532	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and becomes a tRNA and then it travels across the body
13533	5	Prophase metaphase telephase and anaphase
13534	5	The nucleus sends out orders to make out proteins. The mRNA carries those orders and insrtructions for the proteins. Then the mitochondria makes the proteins, and then the proteins are transported other parts of the body where they are needed.
13535	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus, goes to the lysosomes, gives them the code, assembles the protein, and tRNA takes it away
13536	5	Then its the RNA, Protine, Amino Acid, and Sugar.
13537	5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucues the cell divides,it has the same DNA, the cell grows and matures and then divides doing the process over again.
13538	5	after mRNA leaves the nucleus
13539	5	the m RNA travels along the rough ER and then travels to the golgi apperatus and gets shiped off from there.
13540	5	mRNA takes the code for the aminio acid to the Ribosome. This is where the construction of the protein occurs. rRNA copies one strand from the original and tRNA takes the new material to the nucleus where it matches up according to the new code that it has formed. This new RNA has both an orignal copied strand from the first code and a new strand as well.
13541	5	it leaves the nucleus then goes to the nulous, the nulciotide and then it goes to membranes
13542	5	Anti codons match up with codons then ribosomes are made and then proteins are made.
13543	5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis is growing, drinking water, and eatting right.
13544	5	One, mRNA enters the cell.Two, mRNA moves around in the cell.Three, mRNA enter the nucleus. Four, mRNA leaves the cell.
13545	5	mieisos
13546	5	Protein photosynthesis starts by leaving the nucleus.After it leaves the nucleus, it gets transported to the cell wall membrane, to be flushed out of the system. Once that has been done, the mRNA goes through the body to help the body contribute to certain.. things?The next major step is that it completes the cycle, only to start over again as another mRNA leaving the nucleus.
13547	5	It begins to go throughtranslations to change, and then heads to transcriptions then moves immediatly to certain parts of the body.
13548	5	The sequence leaves the nucleus as mRNA. Then the message gets changed into tRNA. Then the sequence moves to the mitochondria as tRNA. Then the message gets decoded so that the body can understand it.
13549	5	The four major steps are interphase, metaphase, prophase, and anaphase.
13550	5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus it rapidly changes and goes through phases and then protein synthesis is prduced.
13551	5	There are four major steps to proteim synthesis. First, Mrna leaves the nucleus with information and takes it to the cytoplasm. From there the information is brken into strands of amino acids. Then it is taken to the mitochandria where energy is taken and then it is taken back to the nucleus. Then the proteins are made. These four steps are a major part in protein synthesis.
13552	5	Four major steps in protein synthesis when mRNA leaves the nucleus is when the mRNA goes through the protein, and the endoplasmic reticulum,
13553	5	When mRNA leaves the nucleus it sends the information to tRNA, tRNA then transcribes the mRNA codon sequence to a specific location that will then be used to start protein synthesis, once it is complete it is taken away and used up.
13554	5	Expansion, radiation, groth, divide
13555	5	The four major steps in protein synthesis is,reproduction, movement, meisos, and mitosis.
13556	5	1. sends the info to be coded.2.translation, sends info to the tRNA3.transcription, translates the info4.transpiration-transportaion of info
13557	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the tRNA comes in and transfers the RNA to the golgi apparatus, and then the receptor proteins come in and produce proteins, and then the DNA strand comes in, and the DNA replicates, making protein synthesis.
13558	5	1) mRNA leaving the nucleus2) mRNA leaving the cell3) mRNA traveling to the brain4) mRNA delivering the message to the brain
13559	5	Once the mRNA leaves it starts its trip to take what ever message it has to the nucleous. Then after that the nucleous receives the message. Next the mRNA returns to its original place. Last it starts all over again.

13567	5	First it leavesSecond it copys to tRNA
13568	5	collecting the energy, using the energy, getting rid of the used up energy, get more energy.
13569	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the next RNAs leave as folled: tRNA, gRNA, and then rRNA.
13570	5	1. The mRNA reads the three letters 2. It makes sure that they are the right letters 3. It puts the three letters togther with the other three letters 4. It puts it where it needs to go
13571	5	1. mRNA2. tRNA3. DNA4. RNA
13572	5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, tRNA brings matching condons along with the corresponding protien to be attached by the rRNA.  After the protien sequence is complete, the newly formed gene and protien sequence travel through the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus until it reaches the protien channel.  The protien channel will then open and allow the sequence to travel to the correct part of the body.
13573	5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis include:1.)  mRNA traveling by use of the Endoplasmic Reticulum2.)  DNA unzips3.)  The new protein is inserted into the section of DNA selected4.)  The DNA is then put back together
13574	5	First the mRNA, which is messenger RNA, that will leave the nucleus. Then from there it will travel to find tRNA, which is transfer RNA. After the mRNA finds the tRNA, it will then travel to the ribosomes. And that is where protein synthesis occurs. And then the process will occur over and over.

13579	5	Its the same as DNA.
13580	5	it goes to the ribosomes to be made,
13581	5	The mRNA makes a copy of itself called tRNA. The tRNA goes to the ribosome where the ribosome attaches to the tRNA strand. The ribosome begins to decode the tRNA into codons, and makes a protien for every codon. The ribosome continues untill it comes across a stop codon, in which it releases the tRNA strand.
13582	5	Carries the information to the mitocondrian.The mitocondrian does its job then eventually makes the protein.
13583	5	genes have protiens and lose themprotien leaves the body protien dies organisms dies
13584	5	The mRNA transports the message to the tRNA. the tRNA then brings the amino acids to the ribosome(rRNA). The ribosome makes the protein.
13585	5	makes tRNA, Translation, replication, transcription
13586	5	The S phase, the G2 phase, the M phase & the G1 phase.
13587	5	It travels out of the cell and trough the membrane. it then goes and trys to find a lysosome cell. it enters the lysosome cell. Then the lysosome cell decodes the mRNA.
13588	5	It gets transferred and then more is made and sent throughout the needed areas.
13589	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it goes to the membrane, through the cell wall, and out of the cell.
13590	5	Carrieing the RNA.Making new mRNA.Making new DNA.Translating mRNA
13591	5	The four main steps involved in protein synthesis is:DNA to mRNA which is called Transcription. Then mRNA to tRNA is Translation. Then the amino acids into codons.
13592	5	after it leaves, then it goes through transcription. then RNA is produced, then it goes through translation, then turns into amino acids

13600	5	The mRNA goes to the ribosomes.The mRNA is copied by proteins.The proteins drop off codons in the order of the RNA.The new strand is put with another strand to make DNA.
13601	5	The mRNA must go find the ribosomes, then find the helper T cells, then they go and find the B cells and have a helper protein through synthesis.
13602	5	The mRNA first gets in the cytoplasm so it can move throughout the cell.Then it gets into the proteins.After that it sarts to make copies of the proteins.Finally, it copies the proteins fully so there are more proteins within the cells.
13603	5	It will change from mRNA to RNA or DNA or even tRNA
13604	5	it is ripped apart copied and put back together
13605	5	RNA must meet with a similiar type of DNA. The DNA and RNA match up, and form an amino acid. The amino acids chain up, creating an amino chain. Then you find the codon.
13606	5	1. mRNA go to the cytoplasm where it combines with rRNA.2. Then, it goes to the ribosomes where transcription occurs.3. After transcription occurs, translation occurs to form tRNA.4. Once the tRNA is formed, it makes an amino acid which helps make the protein.
13607	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus to deliver the information to the rRNA.

13620	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome.2.When the mRNA arrives at the ribosome, it attatches to a start codon, allowing for protein synthesis (translation) to begin.3. Once translation has begun, the ribosome will take tRNA anticodons from within the cell, and attatch them to the mRNA. Then the amino acid is attatched to the tRNA codon, allowing for the amino acid chain to be produced.4. Once the amino acid chain is produced, it leaves the ribosome.

13647	5	Proteins in amino acids are made and distributed, amino acids are made, phosphate groups form, and other sugars are made.
13648	5	mRNA then carries instructions that help protein synthesis.
13649	5	Four major steps that have to occur are mRNA has to sent the RNA, tRNA have to transfer the RNA, rRNA and gRNA.  The Amino acids must be transcribed and translated.
13650	5	mRNA brings amino acids to the nucleus
13651	5	mRNAtRNArRNA
13652	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus with information2. mRNA copies the information to the tRNA3. tRNA takes the information to structures where they are split into codons4. amino acids are formed by the codons
13653	5	prophase mataphase anaphase and interohase are involved in protein synthesis. they all work together to make new cells for the messenger rna to carry to the nucleus.
13654	5	TRANSCRIPTION, TRANSLATION, AMINO ACIDES ARE MADE.  THEN THE AMINO ACIDS MAKE PROTIEANS.
13655	5	1. The mRNA attaches to an amino acid2. The mRNA then finds a tRNA3. The tRNA then transfers the amino acid4. The amino acid becomes a protein
13656	5	they copy
13657	5	First you have to find the protein in the mRNA.Then you create the nucleotidetransfer the RNAcreate the RNA
13658	5	The RNA leaves the nucleus. The Proteins begin to seperate.The proteins are finished seperating. The proteins begin to synthasize.
13659	5	The first step is metaphase which is the cell developing. The second is interphase which is when the  cell slowly starts to come together. The third is prophase where the cells split. the last phase is the restart of metaphase.
13660	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is then transported into tRNA. From there it will be transcribed into rRNA. Then rRNA will be tranformed into proteins.
13661	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleas2. tRNA form over the strand of mRNA and get the protein signature.3. the tRNA recover the needed molecules to create the protein and leave4. the molecules left by the tRNA bind to the mRNA to create a protein.5. the mRNA is destroyed
13662	5	the mRNA is outside of the nucleus which then becomes tRNA and goes into the ribosomes which then produce the amino acids and makes DNA.
13663	5	tRNa to gRNA to rRNA
13664	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and takes the messages or codes to the other RNA'S.
13665	5	The mRNA enters the ribosome. The ribosome then developes instruction to make proteins. The proteins are then entered into the cells. Once they are entered into the cells they get instructions for the genetic material.
13666	5	mRNA leaves nuclues carring the DNA (deoxyribonucleicacid) using the ATP, which helps boost the energy. The RNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence. RNA (ribonucleicacid). Now it makes the proteins and is carried with the ATP. The DNA has the blueprint and information.
13667	5	mitosis, meiosis, S phase, anaphase
13668	5	cleans, reproduces, does its job, helps the body out.
13669	5	Protein synthesis is when the mRNA takes the information and then transfers it throughout the cell. The steps begin with prophase, when the cell begins. Then the cells begin to separate and come together in the middle. Then the one cell begins to split and become two different cells.
13670	5	It matches up with a similar mRNA, then is copies over, then is divides, then it stars over
13671	5	the four major steps are getting protein,sugars and telling the cell what to do
13672	5	mrna attaches to a ribosome, the the mrna combines with trna which forms amino acids, then the amino acid forms a protein.
13673	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to a tRNA, the t RNA copies the information to find the amino acid and gives back to the mRNA. The mRNA goes back to the nucleus. The mRNA gives the information to the nucleus.

13678	5	DNA is transcribed tRNA. The information in the DNA is used to build a protein. Messanger mRNA tells the ribosome how the protein is to be made. The protein has peptide bonds to link it together.
13679	5	first mRNA leaves the nucleussecond the mRNA floating in the cytoplasmthird it creates the coding zipper of genes making the amino acidsfourth then it comes all togther to turn into the proteins
13680	5	MRNA travels to the edge of the cell where the tRNA picks it up. The tRNA codes for the right amino acid. These then combine to form a protein.
13681	5	anapahse ,phrophase,metophace and analyziing
13682	5	Th first step is  going to the trna and getting pushed to the golgui apparatys. Then it goes to the the splace for the preoteins to be made. Then it goes to the plama membrane.
13683	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome. giving the message to the ribosomes to start making proteins. The proteins are made and sent out ot do their jobs.
13684	5	It codes it. It breaks it down. It decodes it. It sends it back
13685	5	1. first protein is coded2. then it is translated3. then transcribed4. and finally it is turned into a protein
13686	5	metaphasetelophaseanaphaseinterphase
13687	5	The four steps in protwinsynthesis starting after the mRNA leaves the nucleus are as followed. The first step is that ribosomes are transfored. The second step is that they are made into antibodies.
13688	5	translation, transformation, then the mRNA take the information to the mitochrondria were the proteins are made.
13689	5	leaving, cutting, putting it back together, and joining back to one another.
13690	5	mRNA leaving the membrane trave to the mitochandria then the tRNA goes to the nuclues and does the transferring
13691	5	1.It grows2.It splits3.It splits the body in two4.You know have two
13692	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus the tRNA enters.  This will be used in the later stepsThe second step is wherethe tRNA moves to another spot in the nucleus.  There it begins to make complementary strands.In the third step the complementary strands are made and connected with the original strand.  The rRNA also enters and recevies important information.Lastly, the tRNA leaves the nucleus and the mRNA reenters, starting the process over.
13693	5	it is cut up into smaller strands then split in two then repared
13694	5	Protein Synthesis consists of sunlight, CO2, and oxygen.
13695	5	One of the major steps for the mRNA is to gather the genetic information and bring it back to the nucleus.
13696	5	sending a message to the nucles
13697	5	The three major steps involved in protein synthesis are tRNA, gRNA, and rRNA.
13698	5	Annaphase, which is when the protien begins the process of meiosis. Interphase, which is when the protien begins to divide into the two daughter cells. Metaphase, which is when the protiens does its crossing over. Prophase, which is the last phase of meiosis.
13699	5	Goes through the cytoplams to the ribosomes then it matches up with the tRNA, which that goes to the nuclous.
13700	5	The first step in the mRNA leaving the nucleus. The secound step in the mRNA binding to a protien, the third is the protien attaching  to another protien.the fourth is the two proteins binding together.
13701	5	next is tRNA which goes to the membrane then the rRNA goes to the ribosomes after that the ribosomes break down and decompose
13702	5	protein is distributed through out the body
13703	5	mRNA, rRNA,tRNA,and gRNa
13704	5	First the mRNA goes to the ribosome.Then the ribosome maakes the proteins.Which then are made into amino acids. Then they are put into a DNA strand to make new DNA.
13705	5	cell communication the small opening for the two cells to comunicate,
13706	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and is transcribed into a protein. It is then coded into amino acids and turned into a polypeptide chain.
13707	5	1) The mRNA finds and attaches to a ribosome.2) Free floating tRNA, with an amino acid, come and attach to the codon on the mRNA that matches with its own anticodon.3) The amino acid disconnects from the tRNA and attaches to the ribosome. 4) Once that is finished, the tRNA disconnects and another floating tRNA attaches to the mRNA. The animo acids bind together by peptide bonds and the protein is formed when the last tRNA disonnects from the mRNA codon.
13708	5	mRNA leaves the nucleusit tells the cell what to do
13709	5	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus mRNA travels to the ribosome.Then translation begins so the other half of the strand will be found.Then mRNA tells tRNA to goout and find the amino acids.Then amino acids are found for the strand of DNA until the stopcodon is found.
13710	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries information to the nucleus. The nuleus puts that information into a DNA sequence made up of amino acids. It then makes a copy of it and it is transfered into another DNA sequence where the codons can be read.
13711	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then enters the ER, drops off the genetic info, then the ER creats protiens.
13712	5	1. The Mrna gets the message.2. Mrna travels through body to necssary place.3. gives or recieves the message sent for.4. Returns to the nucleus
13713	5	make you stonger
13714	5	The first step is it goes to the ribiosomes and they pair up with their matches and then the hydrogen bonds put in order what goes where
13715	5	THE MRNA ENTERS THE MITOCHONDRIA.THEN IT GETS SYNTHESISED.PROTEINS COME IN AND MATCH THE MRNA.AT THE END THE PROTEINS ARE SYNTHESISED AND THE MRNA IS COPIED.

13717	5	mRNA makes protein
13718	5	The tRNA attaches itself to three codons with its anticodons. Then, another tRNA comes and does the same. The pairings make a strand of amino acids.
13719	5	Goes to the mitochondria......
13720	5	mRNA transfers to tRNAafter that codons are createdThey relese nucleotides The nucleotides help to create the protein

13726	5	transportdna replicationtranslationtranscription
13727	5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then enters the cytoplasm wher it goes to the ribosomes. Then codons send a signal to the tRNA and that attaches to the codons on the ribosome. When all the amino acids line up it is called a peptide chain.
13728	5	It carries messages to other cellls.  The messages are carried back. Then the cell uses the information to do stuff. Then the cycle restarts.
13729	5	Protein is createdProtein is usedProtein leavesMore protein is made
13730	5	the four major parts in protein synthesis are tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, and. tRNA takes a copy of the genetic strand abd gives it to the mRNA. the mRNA takes the copy of the genetic strand and carries it out of the nucleus.then the rRNA makes a new copy of the genetic strand.mRNA-messenger RNAtRNA-transfer RNArRNA-ribosomal RNA

13734	5	they have to get energy from the sun.they have to turn that into carbon dioxide.they store the protein in a vacuole.
13735	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus to go to the ribosomes where it is attached to a tRNA molecule which has amino acids and anti codons. The protein synthesis then starts with the AUG codon and begings to use the amino acids to form peptide bonds. The tRNA breaks off when it no longer has amino acids and a new tRNA takes it spot. The protein synthesis will continue making peptide bonds until a stop codon is reached. The peptide bonds then break off, forming a protein.
13736	5	tRNA helps the body fight off the diseaseThe organism then is killed by other helping areas of the body.rRNA- carries instructions from the nucleus gRNA mRNA
13737	5	Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus, four other major steps involved in protein synthesis are 1) the nucleus tells the cell what needs to be done 2) the mRNA finds a ribosome to help make the protein 3) the ribosome starts the process of protein synthesis 4) the protein is made.
13738	5	eating, running, lifting, drinking liquids
13739	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus. mRNA then attachs to some DNA. mRNA then is able to move the DNA. mRNA moves the DNA to a membrane and attachs to it.
13740	5	Messenger RNA leaves the nucleus to start off.Then the bodys antibiotics begin to produce proteins. In which they help heal and keep the body and the immune system healthy.
13741	5	mRNA or messenger RNA leaves the cell and goes to the ribosomes to tell them what to make so the DNA can replicate itself. Then the rRNA or Ribosomal RNA tells the ribosomes what protiens to make to produce the poper Dna needed for replication. Then tRNA or transfer RNA TRansfers the copied DNA Back to the strands of orginal DNA to be fused to gether and produce new DNA
13742	5	new nucleus
13743	5	First the mRNA leaves the membrane and enters the cytoplasm.  Next, it binds to a ribosome, or rRNA.  Transport, or tRNA picks up amino acids and brings them to the ribosome.  Finally, the ribosome, with the help of the tRNA, binds the amino acids together in the order specified by the mRNA.
13744	5	The mRNA must go to the tRNA to be transferred. The mRNA must travel through the nucleus. Then the mRNA must go to the mitochondrion. The mRNA must then transfer its data to the tRNA to be processed.
13745	5	mRNA goes to a gene strand and then takes a codon from there. After, tRNA takes the codon and brings it into a sequence of DNA. Then, the codon
13746	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria with the right materials needed.  Then the Mitochondria uncodes all that information and singles a transfer RNA.  That transfer RNa then goes and locates all the right amino acids to makes that protein.  Then all the amino acids are brought back to the mitochondria and the mitochondria forms or creates that protein.
13747	5	replication
13748	5	sun sun sun sun
13749	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus with the coded instructions. Then the mRNA visits various proteins making the coded instructions more specific and longer. Soon after that the mRNA meets up with a tMNA. Finally the tMNA assists the mRNA by helping the mRNA give the coded instructions to the rRNA.

13755	5	mRNA is the messenger RNA and sends all information back to the cells.tRNA is the transfer RNA and transfers everything to the cells.RNA will just have the code to all the genetic information.DNA has all the codes for eveything else.
13756	5	nucleus, cell membrane, organell,
13757	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleaus. 2. It attaches to a cell organelle.  3. The information in the mRNA is copied into the organelle. 4. The information determines what protien is being made.
13758	5	anaphase , metapahse, prophase, interphase
13759	5	it goes threw the nucleus
13760	5	Transcription is when the mRNA changes form.Translation is when the mRNA meets up at the ribosome to make tRNA.Duplication is when the RNA is duplicated to make more proteins.
13761	5	1.Transcription2.Messenger3.
13762	5	1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus into the rest of the cell.2. The mRNA codons are matched with their complementary strands.3. The amino acid is linked to the others.4. A new strand of protein is made.
13763	5	rRNA constructs the ribosomemRNA feeds into the ribosometRNA reads the mRNAtRNA gets the complementary proteins to create the chain
13764	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus.Then the mRNA takes the codes for making proteins into another cell.The cell reads the code and begins translating what it says to make the amino acid that needs to be produced.The tRNA containing codons bring down each instruction.The cell begins to make the protein and produces what the body needs.
13765	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome. That ribosome then becomes rRNA. The rRNA scans the section of DNA and remembers it. Next, the rRNA gives the information to the tRNA. the tRNA then transfers the information in sections onto the DNA strand.
13766	5	Anaphase-Has all chromosomesMetaphase-They start to splitTelophsae- There are two cellsProphase-
13767	5	1. Two types of RNa read the instructions for making that specific protein.2. Then amino acids are matched to the end on a Rna polymerase3.
13768	5	Leaves the Nucleus,Carries the message for the DNA sequence to the ribosomes,Delivers the message, Goes back to get another message.
13769	5	tRNA transfers the DNA and carries it to the cell membrane. tDNA copies the DNA.
13770	5	First, DNA is replicated and is coded for the new sequence. In mRNA, the DNA sequence is read and is coded into an mRNA sequence. That step is called transcription. Next, the mRNA sequence is coded for an amino acid sequence. That step is called translation. In translation, tRNA is used to help code for the amino acids. Once the tRNA is coded into an amiono acid sequence, protein synthesis is complete.
13771	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA meets with the tRNA, then the mRNA tells the tRNA how to make the protein, and finally the protien is made.
13772	5	MRNA LEAVES THE NUCLEUS.MRNA GOES TO WERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO.     MRNA GIVES THE MESSAGE.
13773	5	The four major steps are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telaphase.
13774	5	It goes through tRNA and rRNA
13775	5	The mRNA transcribesIt travels to the protien syntesis siteProtien synthesis
13776	5	Nucleus is part of a cell.
13777	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleous it travels to tRNA.  This is where it delivers the message as to what kind of proteins to make.  The tRNA decodes the message and starts to create peptide bonds.  After multiple peptide bonds are formed you have a polypeptide bond.  This is the begining of protein synthesis.
13778	5	they are being synthesised
13779	5	mutation
13780	5	Carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid to make a sequence.
13781	5	Gases and porteins are the oppiste of DNA
13782	5	The first step is tRNA goes and gets the message from mRNA. The second step is tRNA then goes to the mRNAThe third step is that mRNA gives it to the gRNAThe fourth and final step is gRNA givis it to the brain which gives off synthesis
13783	5	When mRNA leaves the nucles, the ribosomes start with protein synthesis. If you have more ribosomes, the cell will have more protein.
13784	5	It goes outAttatches to the DNAIt spends into two strandsThen it makes protein synthesis
13785	5	Proteins are transferred from the nucleus with mRNA. They then go to the rest of the body. They supply the body with energy. Then they come back to the nucleus and start the process over again.
13786	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the ribosome.
13787	5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it will go into translatio. This occurs when the chromosomes attach to the single stranded RNA, they have a certain amino acid, then another chromosome comes and attaches to the strand. That new strand has another amino acid in which they will attach together and form a peptide bond, after that happens that bond will stay in the newer chromosome, it will then slide down the strand until it reaches the stop codon. Along the way more peptide bonds were formed which led to a lng strand of amino acids. Those will then transfer into proteins and brought into another part of the cell and become enzymes. this occurs in the ribosome.
13788	5	Nucleolic acid, proteins, simple sugar...
13789	5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries a code to make the protein. It gives the code to a complementary strand and they fit together. The RNA starts making amino acids. Finally the  amino acids string together like a puzzle to form the protein.
13790	5	mitochondria and ribosomes. and nucleic acids
13791	5	When the mRNA leaves the cell it is then read and changed into tRNA. That process is called transcription. Then the tRNA is translated is into an amino acid sequence, during translation. Then an enzyme reads the codon and makes an anticodon. Then the anticodon is formed into an amino acid.
13792	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. the mRNA transfers information to the nucleotide.3.nucleotide gathers all the information.4. nucleotide pushes it all out of the cell.
13793	5	1. mRNA finds a ribosome.2. mRNa gets connected to ribosome.3. The base pairs change to go with their complementary base of rna.4. The codons attach to their anticodons
13794	5	first, it trys to keep it out out.second, they have to take it got, so it goes through your boby or back out. third, they try to kill/ or get rid of it. last, they send it out of your body.
13795	5	The four major steps are translation, transition, mRNA, and                tRNA.1. translation - when the protein starts to move out of the nucleus2. transition - when the protein moves throughout the cell3. mRNA - they move the protein out of the nucleus4. tRNA - they move the protein where it needs to go throughout                     the cell
13796	5	it goes to the ribsomes then to the mitochondria to make the protein
13797	5	The mRNA makes the proteins, sends them to be packaged, and then the proteins are shipped off throught the Golgi Apparatus.
13798	5	the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the cell divides makes two new ones, and then mRNA comes back into the two new sister cells
13799	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2. protein molecules are brought into the cell3. the protein moecules are broken down for use4. the protein is used and the process repeates its self
13800	5	the crosing over of proteins.
13801	5	Copying each other
13802	5	trna and rrna
13803	5	First, tRNA will pull the DNA sequence for the protein apart. Second, rRNA will use this sequence as a model and copy the codon sequence. Next, the new copied sequence will form the amino acids. Finally, the amino acids will form a protein and begin its job.
13804	5	1.)mRNA leaves the nucleus 2.)tRna transfers the message to the ribosome3.)The ribosome carries the message to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum4.)The Rough ER takes the ribosome and the message and checks the gene frequencies to see if the cell will be mutated or not.
13805	5	mRNADNa
13806	5	Transcription and Translation and amino acids are all in protein synthesis.
13807	5	The mRNA is carried to the tRNA through translation. The tRNA is moved to the rRNA through transcription. The rRNA is moved to the ribosome.
13808	5	Transcription- when the DNA is turned into mRNA.Transfusion- when the mRNA leaves the nucleus.Translation- when the mRNA turns into amino acids.
13809	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it then travels to the protein. When it leaves the protein it goes to the tRNA and that RNA goes and get energy and from there i dont know what happens.
13810	5	1. Takes the data to a transfer RNA2. Decodes it3. makes it into a protein4. sends to where it needs to go
13811	5	1.) mRNA does its job2.) Mutations occur3.) Sythensising begins4.) The process endsp.s. gRNA, rRNA and tRNA
13812	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and then is met by the rRNA to copy the message. After this is complete it then is transferred tRNA, and then shipped to gRNA for packing.
13813	5	the mrna recopies.
13814	5	The mRNA goes to the ribosome where tRNA attaches to the mRNA strand. Then the tRNA codons code the mRNA. The protiens attached to the tRNA bond together to make the protein as tRNA codes the mRNA. Each tRNA part falls out as another one attaches and codes.
13815	5	Absorb the protein your body needs.get rid of the waste.and send the protein.
13816	5	1. A strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus to find a ribosome.2. The strand of mRNA attaches to a ribosome to wait to have a tRNA attach to it.3. Several tRNA with only three base pairs at the bottom and a single amino acid at the top, attach the mRNA codes that match up. 4.  The tRNA leave after the next tRNA takes it's amino acid to produce an amino acid chain. Eventually, the mRNA will have a stop codon, and when the last tRNA attaches to it, the amino acid chain will be the protein.
13817	5	When it starts out the letters are CGAT and when it changes CGAU T changes to U.
13818	5	1- mRNA will attatch itself to a ribosome, making rRNA. The Ribosome will send out tRNA attatched to a aminoacid and an anticodon. 2- tRNA will match the anti codon with the codon from the original strand of DNA. 3- The aminoacids will start to form a chain. During a PolyPeptide 'Assebly Line.'4- When the 'stop' codon gets matched with it's anticodon. the protien is formed.
13819	5	1)mitochondria gives cells protein
13820	5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it moves to the ribososmes, where tranlation occurs. This is when the anticodons attach to the codons. The anticodons are carrying an amino acid for each of the specific amino acid sequence. Once the first amino acid attaches, another one attaches, connecting the amino acids together. Then, the first anticodon leaves the mRNA codon, and another attaches, taking the previous amino acid. After this is over, the amino acids run into a stop codon, amking an amino acid.
13821	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus, containing all the information needed to make new DNA.2. The DNA protein is unzipped by a form of RNA.3. The tRNA then transfers the existing strand of DNA onto a new strand and is zipped back up.4. The new strand is then coded for its proteins and is sent on its merry way.
13822	5	As the protein leaves the nucleus it goes to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum which sorts it. It then it passed to the Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum which packages it. Its then shipped to the Golgi Apparatus where it is the shipped out of the cell.
13823	5	tRNA is madetRNA conects to sonmthing
13824	5	First the mRNA is taken to a nucleus. second, it goes through a chain where it release energy at each level.
13825	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a nucleus pore. After the mRNA leaves the nucleus the mRNA finds the ribsome which is located in the cytoplasm. The mRNA connects with the first condon on the ribsome. Then the tRNA comes and connects with the first codon and the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm. Then the tRNA realeases the amino acid that is connected to the tRNA.
13826	5	mrna takes the dna from the nuclues and sends it around in the cell to be copyed.then trna decodes the dna strand and makes more of it to the body so the body can easyly pick the things it needs to copy.then the cell splits into two and makes one more strand to keep off to the side just incase something gets taken away from the cell.
13827	5	the four steps are
13828	5	mRNA takes the codons from the nucleus.Then it goes through transcription.Then translation.tRNA makes the correct amino acid.
13829	5	mRNA attach themselves to a the other half of a DNA strand. They use reverse transcriptase. Next tRNA link together in chains of 3 codons that code for an amino acid which is the building blocks of proteins. The tRNA then take these codes to be converted into amino acids.
13830	5	Leaves the nucleus to get to the protien.Makes copies of itself.
13831	5	ReciveSettle In Beggin reproducing
13832	5	The rRNA goes and tells the ribosome to make the protein, so then the mRNA attaches to the ribosome, then that attracts an amino acid, and then the tRNA transports the amino acid to the ribosome, and the process keeps going until the protein is complete.
13833	5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus it then produces to the ribosomes, which begin to leave the cell Through the endoplasmic reticulum they are attached to.  After they are through the endoplasmic reticulum they proceed to the Golgi Apparatus in order to then leave the cell.
13834	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus, goes to the ribosome, gets packaged golgi apparatus, and exits the cell.
13835	5	mRNA     --     is the messenger RNAtRNA     --     is the transporter RNA, this transports segments of DNA to their matching parts.
13836	5	The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are making proteins, repairing damaged cells, making new cells, and fighting off unknown microorganisms.
13837	5	Step 1: The mRNA attaches to the smaller subunit ribosome.Step 2: The complimentary anticodons attach to the codonsStep 3: The amino acids are brought in to attach to anticodons.Step 4: The codons are released and the finished product is a                    protein.
13838	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus,
13839	5	mutating, moving
13840	5	1) The spliting apart of the DNA strand2) The coping of the DNA 3) The mRNA going out of the cell4) The mRNA contact with the ribosome
13841	5	tRNA attaches to mRNA and gets the information on how to build the protein needed.tRNA meets up with rRNA and rRNA starts to build the protein.the protein is then almost finished once finished there is a new straind of RNA  and there is only one straind and there are no hydrogen bonds.
13842	5	informaton, gathering, distribution, and connection
13843	5	mRNA takes messages to the brain.
13844	5	The mRNA takes the amino acid code for the tRNA to copy. The mRNA attaches to the amino acid with its codons. The tRNA copies the amino acid code until it reaches a stop code. A restriction enzyme cuts the DNA strand. The amino acids form a chain as monomers and form proteins. These proteins form DNA strands.
13845	5	Cell cylcle. Golgi cleaning the cell.
13846	5	The mRNA go to a ribosome where translation occurs. This is where mRNA is copied to tRNA. After that the tRNA has the codons that code for amino acids. Once amino acids are made, they are ready to be combined to make proteins.
13847	5	Firstly, from the nucleus, mRNA is transported to the ribosome, then the ribosome uses the mRNA as a template for the protein, then the protein is transpored to the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it is stored.
13848	5	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels around the cytoplasm looking for a ribosome.  Once found, the ribosome splits into two separate pieces, one considerably larger than the other.  These fragments then clamp onto the mRNA and begin to decode the mRNA sequence.  Each codon is matched with tRNA that is attached at the other end to an amino acid corresponding to the codon 'blueprint.'
13849	5	1. mRNA carries out the instructions to proteins2. Proteins redevelope in the mitochondria3. Mitochondria processes and icreases protein4. Protein is released to provide energy
13850	5	Step 1: the nucleus tells the other parts of the cell it needs to make more protiens.
13851	5	The exchange of proteins
13852	5	Four major steps are leaving the nucleus then going to the cell wall then going to the cell membrane then leaving and becoming RNA.
13853	5	1.Transfer RNA transfers info to mRNA2.RNA is duplicated
13854	5	getting sun rays, converting them, eating the sugars, and releasing the oxygen.
13855	5	1. giving off the protiens to the DNA.2. traveling through the stream to deliever the protiens.3. the making of the protiens.4.copying the protiens so there is more than one if that one may get mutated.
13856	5	mRNA, divides, reproduces, come back again.
13857	5	step1 you got to know what is rong. Step2 then you find a doc.  Step3 then you go see a doctor. Step 4 then he gives you the medicine.
13858	5	the messenger RNA take the DNA to the protein Reader.the mRNA decode the strands.the strand goes in and gets read.It delivers the message.
13859	5	mRNA codes for making the proteins ourside the nucleus. A polypeptide chain is formed. This takes place in the cytoplasm. All of these processes are done during translation.Translation comes after Transcription.
13860	5	1.Leaving the Nuclear membrane- the mRNA leaves the nucleus to deliver the message.2.Traveling through the cytoplasm- the mRNA goes to throught he cytoplasm to do its job.3.Approaching the Mitochondria- the mRNA gives the information to the mitochondria.4.Creating the Proteins- the mitochondria creates the proteins through codons.
13861	5	tRNA is sent to the metabolism. Then the tRNA comes back to the missplaced DNA strand. Then the tRNA switches the strands.
13862	5	mRNA pairs with RNA synthase in the ribosomecodons translate the mRNA into nucleic acids protiens are structured from the nucleic acidsprotien is released to the needed area
13863	5	mRNA Leaves the nucleus with translated DNA, then goes over to the Ribosomes, where it will transribe the blueprint of the protein it wants, then it will read it off and make the protein.
13864	5	The four major steps are transferring, changing, reproducing, and to synthesize.
13865	5	first mRNA has to get its self out. Then the nucleolus will take it through a procces. then the powerhouse of the cell will help out more.mitrocondria will help it all the way through.
13866	5	it carries the strain of dna and copies it in the new cells that were just created
13867	5	1. Losing mRNA- mRNA leaves the nucleus2. mRNA traveling- mRNA going to destination3. mRNA receives- mRna gets what it needs or wants4. mRNA Storage- stored in the nucleus
13868	5	mRNA leaves the cell and conects with tRNA and the tRNA takes the sequence to a ribosome that then attaches on to it and starts to produce amino acids that link up to form a chain.
13869	5	getting energygetting protien
13870	5	The tRNA brings the complementary nuclodies in and they hook up with the nuclotides. The nucleotides read the nucloeties that were brought in and they code. The stop codon comes in and the complementary nucleoties leave amino acids there and the nucleoties leave the ribosome and go to get more nucleotidse. The protein is saved in the ribosome of the cell in the amino acids and is keptin there until the body needs it.
13871	5	it splits in two, its growing , its almost complete and then the RNA its form
13872	5	changing the mRNA into the tRNA ans finding the right names fro them
13873	5	The amino acids separate and find their matching amino acid.
13874	5	The mRNA sends the message to the proteins.
13875	5	the mRNA is transcriped.polypeptides form.Polpeptides are snythesisedproteins form
13876	5	when mRNA leaves the nucleus proteins are made and moved top the nucleus.

13878	5	mRNA leaves the nucleus
13879	5	trna rrna
13880	5	Protein synthesis starts when the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Next the mRNA finds a new host and it connects with another strand of DNA. Then the mRNA replicates with the other strand. Then they split apart, and the process happens again.
13881	5	food, water, sunlight, protein.
13882	5	1. Undo the cell wall2. The cells starts  to divide3. The mRNA starts to separate4. The cycle is complete and there is two new cells
13883	5	The DNA polymerase unzips the DNA and the mrna rushes in to make a copy. after copying the mRNA leave the DNA zips back up and the mRNA visits the tRNA
13884	5	During protein synthesis, the mRNA leaves the nucleus after copying the DNA during transcription. Translation occurs making the information readable for the other parts of the cell. The DNA copy is taken to the ribosome by the tRNA. In the ribosome, the information is used to make proteins.
13885	5	They give you energy. They help stay awake. the control what you look like.
13886	5	mRNA hooks up with RNA
13887	5	mRNA has to find its way to the robosomesthen if has to turn information into a small strip so it can be read it's not as big anymore. THen T cells must read it.
13888	5	Meiosis, mitosis, homeostasis, and
13889	5	mrna then trna and then finally rrna
13890	5	it breaks down then it gathers chemicals then it rebuilds then it seals off
13891	5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it sends a message to the ribosomes where protein synthesis takes place. This message tell the ribosomes to produce proteins.
13892	5	The
13893	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleuys heading to the cytoplasm. There the protiens seperate to form more protiens.
13894	5	they need sunlight, they must consume proteins, they all must participate in the sequence, and they must reproduce
13895	5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes to the rough er and gets modified into a protein. Then gets sent to the goli body to become more speicic then once it leaves there it there goes to the smooth er to be modified more or gets sent throughout the cells to do its job it was made to do.
13896	5	mRNA carries information from nucleus for Amino Acid sequence of a protein, Amino Acid sequence is decoded, Amino Acids are sorted and packaged by golgi apparatus, then proteins are synthesized and sent where they need to go.
13897	5	When the mRNA leaves.., the DNA starts to get stronger and change the proteins, which also, makes the nucleus gain.
13898	5	The mRNA then finds a tRNA. It then matches up its genetic information with the tRNA. After all of the sequences have been matched up. The sequence creates a new protein.
13899	5	translation-transcription
13900	5	The sun has to help the platnt produce the sugars needed in photosynthesis.
13901	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus is one of the steps. Another step is that the DNA polymerase splits apart the DNA strand. Another step is that an RNA strand connects with the Other RNA strand. Another step is that it makes a new DNA strand.
13902	5	1. The RNA leaves the nucleus. 2. The nucleus reacts.3. The nucleus becomes infected.4. The RNA spreads throughout the body.
13903	5	1. mRNA travels to the rRNA                                                   2. tRNA with an anticodon and an amino acid matches itself to corresponding codons on the RNA strand.                                  3. When attached the tRNA releases a amino acid.                      4. Tha amino acid then links on to a polypeptide chain, also known as a protien.                                                                       This process is transcription.
13904	5	1. Attaches to other mRNA2. Information is exchanged3. Proteins break off mRNA4. Proteins exit the cell
13905	5	Protein Synthesis has four major steps.
13906	5	mRNA is then translated into RNA and then a the  codons are selected and then made into a new RNA strand
13907	5	it leaves thje nucleuos and goes to the mitochondria and then goes to the golgi apparatus
13908	5	the mRNA leaves the nucleus. It is sent to the active site. The active site then copies the mRNA sequence. The transporter RNA takes the sequence out. last the protein sequence is laced together to form the protein.
13909	5	It unwinds the mRNA. Then it codes the mRNA. Then it Zips it back up. Then it goes outside of the cell.
13910	5	anaphase
13911	5	First in order the major steps involving protein synthesis is that the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes into the bloodstream, next it goes straight into the liver, also it goes and injects its genetic DNA into the protein, then last it goes back directly to the bloodstream.
13912	5	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it finds the gene sequence. When it finds the sequence, it the attaches. After the attachment if breaks off at certain parts. And then it becomes a ribosome, and after, it enters the membrane and becomes a protein.
13913	5	One of the steps is putting them into groups. Second is using the proteins to make amino acids.  The third to to turn teh amino acids into strands of DNA.  The last step is to to have them bonded together.
13914	5	mrna leaves then dnra comes
13915	5	The four steps involved in protein synthesis are translation, transcription...Translation is when carrier proteins are made.Transcription is when transport proteins are made.
13916	5	The mRNA leaves the nuclues to the ribosome, to the tRNA. There, tRNA transcribes it so that the cell knows what proteins to produce. Then, the protein is made.
13917	5	collecting the information. Relplicating it. They transporting it and soon useing it.

13920	5	1. mRNA assigning jobs2. rRNA getting the parts together3. tRNA creating the proteins4. Sending the proteins to do certain jobs
13921	5	mRNA is instructions for protein synthesis.The tRNA transports the instructions to the proteins.The amino acids are made or created. The amino acids are put together to make proteins.
13922	5	rna carries messages from dna to specific places in the body.

13924	5	first the messages are sent to be deliveredsecond the messages are retrievedthird the brain tells the body what has to be donefourth the immune system does the work
13925	5	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and begins to replicate. After replicating it separates from its twin.
13926	5	The mRNA has a code that builds proteins. It fills these codes producing protein untilit reaches a stop codon. The protein is then taken to other parts of the body.
13927	5	First, mRNA leaves the nuclues. Then, it is taken to the amino acids. Which then take is to the endoplasmic retiulum to read the information. Last is is made into the protein.
13928	5	The mrna heads to the ribosome.
13929	5	After the message gets sent, the proteins then transfer to the DNA strand which then gets absorbed into the strand creating a polypeptide bond.
13930	5	In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm. Then, the tRNA comes in to deliver the coding of the amino acid sequence to the rRNA, who then takes the coding to the ribosome to make the proteins.
13931	5	the DNA getting its orders to make new protein and the dostrubing it through out the body.
13932	5	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, that is the first step. The mRNA, or messenger RNA, carries instructions to the tRNA. The transfer RNA, or tRNA, carry information for building proteins to the amino acid sequence. Then more proteins for the body are created through that sequence.
13933	5	the messenger mRNA leaves the nucleus...
13934	5	1. mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying instuctions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of the protein2. the mRNA wraps itself around a protein3. The protein takes the information4. The mRNA splits in two and attaches itself to another piece of mRNA and creates a new strand of DNA
13935	5	1) After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein.2) I can't remember.3) I can't remember.4) I can't remember.
13936	5	1. The mRNA uses the information from the DNA to create codons of the three bases.2. Anticodons are created to match the codon.3. When codons and anticodons are matched, they make the enzymes.4. Enzymes are used to transcribe proteins.
13937	5	It goes to the tRNA then to the cytoplasm then on a ribosome, and comes back to the nucleus.
13938	5	the mRNA leaves the nucleus then travels to its designated area. the mRNA then delivers the bodys 'information' that sent it
13939	5	First, the mRNA finds a ribosome and attaches to it.  Second, the anticodon ,with the amino acid attached to it, matches up to the first codon.  Third, a second anticodon matches up and the amino acid from the previous anticodon attaches to the other amino acid with a peptide bond.  Fourth, this goes on until the stop codon is read and the protein is complete.

13941	5	Transition, Translation
13942	5	It helps the proteins move along faster.It goes through your blood stream and kills all the bad bacteria.It helps build up the protein in your body.It builds up the protein so that way you cant get sick easier.
13943	5	1) The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosomes.2) In the ribosome the mRNA is changed into DNA.3) It leaves the ribosome and goes to the rest of the cells4) then the rest of the organells in the cell change the dna and do all their jobs.
13944	5	mRNA leaves and goes an attaches to tRNA to make the sequence.  The the sequence is sent to be the new copyed one to the eggs.

13950	5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus it then goes to make a protien. The codon reads the mRNA and transcribes the information sending it to the protein, which then travels through out the cell relaying the message, or information.
13951	5	One is the mRNA leaving, two is finding the mitochondria, three is the miotchondria making a copy of the mRNA, and four is the mRNA copy is sent to the nucleus.
13952	5	the protein changes over time.

16380	6	They can use active transfer, which is a way cells use energy to move something in or out of its membrane. They could use osmosis, which uses no enery and is the movement of water through the cell. They could also use passive transfer, which lets particles in or out of the cell when the cell is letting particles of high presure move into areas of low presure.
16381	6	1.Diffusion-this process allows molecules to move in and out of the cell depending on high/low concentration.2.Active Transport-when a cell membrane can move up against diffusion pushing molecules in or out of the cell.3.Facilitated Diffusion-protein channels allow certain substances to move in/out of the cell depending on size and which substance is trying to get in.

16395	6	1. ENDOCYTOSIS IS WHERE TOXINS ARE REMOVED2. HOMEOSTASIS IS WHERE THE MEMBRANE CONTROLLS WHAT COMES AND GOES IN A CELL
16396	6	The cell uses diffusion to control what enters the cell and what does not. In duffusion, the cell allows certain particles to enter and leave the cell and does not allow other particles to enter or leave the cell.
16397	6	One process is osmosis this allows the cell to let water enter it, but not other substances. Another process is facillitated diffusion this allows bigger molecules to enter the cell that the cell needs for energy and to fuction. A third process is cell membrane regulation this allows the membrane to regulate what enters and leaves the cell.

16401	6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across a cell membrane.
16402	6	Diffusion is when substances move from high concentration to low concentration.  If there is less inside the cell and  more outside of the cell, they will naturlly move inside the cell.Phagosytosis is when the cell's membrane reahes out to take molecules from its soroundings.Osmosis is when the cell's membrane makes pockets where molecules flow into and the cell closes them of.  The pockets then act as mitochondria.

16422	6	The cells the control the movement of  substances across the cell membrane by moving waste and materials
16423	6	Three cell processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the membrane.  Active transport uses energy to move subtansces. Pasive transport uses no energy.
16424	6	They can move substances in three ways, hydrolysis, active diffusion and passive diffusion.  Hydrolysis uses water while active and passive diffusion are actions that the cell makes in order to move the substance.
16425	6	WaterBlood.Sugar
16426	6	Diffusion is when the cell uses no energy to have the items enter or exit the cell through a selectively permeable membrane. Exocytosis is a form of active transport, the cell uses proteins and enzymes to remove bulk items from the cell. Endocytosis is also a form of active transport that uses the proteins in the cellular membrane; this form of active transport brings in bulk items to the cell, such as food.

16430	6	Permeability is the restriction on what enters or leaves the cell. Endocytosis is when the cell absorbs something from the outside. Exocytosis is when it gets rid of wastes and other things.
16431	6	the membrane can stop it from moving across and also the liquid inside
16432	6	The Plasma Membrane because it is semi permiable its able to control what crosses the plasma membrane. Duffusion is breaking down a part of a cell. Osmoasis because it has to do with water which helps things move throughout the cell.
16433	6	Ribosomes make protiens that can move across the membrane. Eukaryotes can also move across the membrane. The things that cross the membrane are controlled by what acts as a highway system.
16434	6	there are tubes in cells that let some things in and out, but not others. these are too large to go in through the cell membraine, so they have to be let in that way.
16435	6	DiffusionOsmosis- when things from a loow concentrated area move to a high concentrated area
16436	6	They use the nucleaus
16437	6	DIFFUSION, CELL RESPERATION, AND MITOSIS
16438	6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are osmosis, active transport, and mitosis.

16440	6	KNOWING WHERE TO GO.HOW TO GO.WHAT TO ESPECT.
16441	6	Diffusion: movement of substance from high to low concentrationOsmosis: movement of water to different concentrationsEndocytosis: sunstance coming into the cell
16442	6	The cells use diffusion, respiration, and
16443	6	Protists, nucleus and blood.
16444	6	Anaphase, mataphase, telaphase.
16445	6	1. Somethimg bus carry them to the membrain.
16446	6	Passive Transport, Active Transport, and Facitated Transport. In Passive transport it uses no energy and goes with gradient. Active transport uses energy and goes against the gradient. Facitated Transport uses no energy but goes against the gradient.
16447	6	They have selectively permisable membranes, they the rough endoplacmic reticulum, and the  cell membrane tells what goes on for the cell.
16448	6	the cells move around through the body.
16449	6	One process is osmosis.  This allows the movement of water around cells, which will also help to carry other substances across the cell membrane.  Another process is when there is an opening in the cell membrane, substances can get through.  A third process is when a virus runs through the cell and causes interference.
16450	6	The surface area must increase. The membrane must take in more food or energy.
16451	6	One process is called active transport by carrier proteins. Active transport is when substances are moved into a cell against the concentration gradient, so energy is used as the carrier proteins bind with the molecule and allow the molecule through the membrane. Another process is passive transport by carrier proteins. Passive transport is when there is no energy required because the molecules are moving with the concentration gradient. The carrier molecules work the same way as they did for active transport. Passive transport by channel proteins is another process. Passive transport is the same thing, but channel proteins are used as molecules slide through them instead of binding directly to them.
16452	6	One of the ways a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is for the mRNA to take it across the ribsomes. Another is the cytoplasm slowly moving it across. A third way is to block off most of the area around the membrane to let only few substances move across the cell membrane at once.
16453	6	cells move on the cell mebrane.
16454	6	Theres active transport where the nucleus controls the what enters and leaves the cell. And theres cell could have a semipermeable membrane which half and half what's on the inside of the nucleus and whats on the outside is even. and theres a permeable membrane which there could be any given amount of cells in or out of the nucleus.
16455	6	The three processes for substance movement are: facilitated diffusion, active transport, and passive transport.
16456	6	The endoplasmic reticulum helps the movement of molecules around the cell because it is a tunnel like item that help it move through the cell. The Golgi apparatus packages molecules for them to travel across the cell. The lysosomes are used stop to stop the movement of any unwanted cells across the cell.
16457	6	osmosis, diffusion,exocytosis
16458	6	They use diffusion. This requires no energy. Active transport is the second one. This uses some energy to pull it through. The third is passive transport. This requires the the substance to be surrounded or consumed and moved through.
16459	6	They controle the move ment in a cellthey make energy for a cellthey provid portechtion for the cell
16460	6	Openings in the cell wall that allows certain things in and out.
16461	6	Passive Transport lets water enter the cell without using much energy. Exocytosis let's substances exit the cell. Endocytosis let's substances enter the cell.
16462	6	Mitosis, meosis, translation.
16463	6	transportation, respiration,
16464	6	Three ways a cell can control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, diffusion, and endocytosis.     In active transport, a cell controls the import and export of substances using energy. In active transport, the cell can diffuse substances without maintaining equalibrium.     In diffusion, the cell regulates substances in two ways, osmosis and facilitated diffusion. In osmosis, water diffuses into the cell. While in facilitated diffusion, the cell diffuses larger substances through protein channels.     In endocytosis, the cell maintains the movement of substances through phagocytois and pinnocytosis. In phagocytosis, the cell engulfs a substance which puts the substance inside the cell. In pinnocytosis, the cell creates straw-like holes that let liquid-like substances into the cell.
16465	6	Semi permable membranes help to allow certain substances in, and certain substances out, by checking the DNA of an organism.mRNA helps send instructions to different cells in the body telling them their function and where they should go.tRNA helps organelles etc., move around the cell by transferring information to the organelles.
16466	6	Cells have a semi permeable membrane, which is a passive form of nutrient movement. they have phagocytosis which wis where the cell memebrane closes around something and the cell 'eats' it. There is Pinocytosis which wis where a vacoule becomes part of the cell wall and nutrients are expelled.
16467	6	Three processes that are used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are : Vacuoles they help store any left over information, Lysomes they synthesis the proteins, and the outter membrane they kick out any information that doesn't need to be there.
16468	6	The process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is they have to be immune to it, they have to fight it off, and they have to know what to do if they come back.

16485	6	The cell makes the movement slow so it has time react. It makes the movement process an easy process. It has no flagella.
16486	6	They use the eqqulibrium
16487	6	cells use ion protien chanels to control sertain protiens from going in or out of the cell. they also use premeability to control how much water they will let in or out of the cell. finally cells also use carrier protiens to only alow certain things to come in and out of the cell that are to large for them to fit through the membrane or the ion protien channells

16492	6	Some cells have a flagelum, or cilia which are hair like structures outside of the cell, or the cell would be moved along by their surroundings.
16493	6	They use ion channels get in and out of the cell.
16494	6	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of the cell membrane are the mitosis cycle, meiosis cycle, and photsynthesis. Although photosynthesis generally creates food for the membrane.
16495	6	diffusion

16518	6	1. Membrane proteins monitor traffic in the cell.2. Golgi apparati monitor and control waste removal in the cell. 3.
16519	6	Cells use many processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Osmosis helps the cell obtain equilibrium by moving water from a high concentration to a low concentration. Diffusion helps cells regulate movement by moving particles from a high concentration to a low concentration. Ion channels that are ran by chemical or electical messages helps large particles such as ions across the cell membrane. All of these process help the cell obtain equilibrium and homeostasis.
16520	6	1. The cell has a wall which can allow or deny access to the cell.2. The cell has enzymes that if something harmful is able to gain access to the cell they will destroy it or alert the body immediatly.3.
16521	6	1. Cytoplasm: it moves substances through the cell2. Cell Walls3. Cell Membrane
16522	6	They use the cytoplam to make it hard for the substance to move, the cell membrane is thick and hard to get through, and there is a cell wall.
16523	6	Cells have substances move arcoss the cell membrane because it is trying to reach equillibrium
16524	6	The cell membrane is the thing that keeps organelles from leaving the cell. It sends a message to the nucleaus and the nucleus will tell them whether or not it is trash and can be discarded or if it needs to stay inside.
16525	6	flagellum
16526	6	The cell wall keeps the substances in tact and from leaving the cell. The nucleus tells where the substances needs to go.

16540	6	The cell membrane protects the entire cell. It only allows certain substances in or out. The membrane is made up of lipids. These lipids only allow substances in that are helpful to the cell. Plant cells also have a cell wall for extra protection. The nucleus is the brain of the cell and tells the cell membrane what is good or bad.
16541	6	1.) flagella - helps move the cell.2.) cilla - provides help with the moving of the cell.3.) nucleus - tells the organelles what to do.

16543	6	cells can control the energy.
16544	6	Facilitated diffusion, active transport, and diffusion
16545	6	Cells go through a process which includes prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In these steps the cell is controlled on how much it may divide, or multiply to make more cells. After Telophase, the cycle repeats back to prophase. In Metaphase the cells line up in the middle, and split to the out layer of the cell wall in the stop called Anaphase. Prophase, the cells begin to get ready to be divided.
16546	6	They use Osmosis to control the water intake and output throughout the cell.
16547	6	They use miosis for movement, fibrosis, mitosis. They all help it  to move substances acrossed the cell membrane.
16548	6	One way to move material across the membrane is using simple diffusion.  Simple diffusion is simply the movement of matter from a higher concentration to areas with a lower concentration.Another way is using facilitated transport.  The type of movement using special proteins to help the substance move with the concentration gradient, without using any energy.  The last kind of movement is active transport.  Active transport uses special carrier proteins to help different substances move against the concentration.  Active transport does use energy.

16553	6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, active transport, and osmosis.
16554	6	anaphase,interphase,and prophase
16555	6	One process that it goes through is that it is pushed through layers of cell membrain. Another one is that it checked by different cells to make sure that it is not effective. Also the last process is when it reaches the cell membrane it goes through a cell wall into the cell membrane.
16556	6	Cells may utilize the processes of both active and passive transport mechanisms, which include the following:1. Active Transport, which transfers substances against the concentration gradient of the cell membrance, thus utlizing energy. Examples of this mechanism are the sodium-potassium pump, which allows for ions of potassium to be diffused into the outer covering of the cell. 2. Passive Transport, which allows substancs to diffuse across the concentration gradient of the cell membrane, which does not use cellular energy. 3. The third method, diffusion, is the transfer of material from an area of higher concentration, to a region of lower concentration across the cellular membrane. Each of these techniques results in the movement of certain substances into or out from the cell.
16557	6	the cells diffuse the substances across the membrane
16558	6	Holes in the membrane that prevent bigger things from coming through. The cell membrane is created by lipids that are attracted to each other but not bonded allowing it to open for necessary things to pass through. The cell membrane is a mosaic model.

16560	6	osmosis diffusion and portien carry
16561	6	the three thing that you have to do is cell membrance and the brain and the mukist.
16562	6	The cells use their tails in a whip-like way to move about. They also swim across the chlorplasts within the cell. Finally, they divide and the dividing cells spread out across the cell membrane.
16563	6	They use diffusion, the cells aborbs nutrients for energy, and they use photosynthesis to get the sun's energy to keep moving.
16564	6	IT BREAKS DOWN CELLS.
16565	6	One process a cell uses to move substances around would be osmosis. Another process in which cells use to move substances would be passive transport.
16566	6	osmosis: The cell gain or loose water through a concentration gradient.exocytosis: Process used by the cells to take out particles that will not be used anymore by the cell.endocytosis: Process used by the cells where the cell membrane opens and envolves a big particle of substance to be used by the cell.
16567	6	They have pores that filter things in and out of the cell, they have doorways or vessels that open and close, and they also use smaller pores that allow smaller things to get in.
16568	6	1.) Nuleous2.) Plant cells3.) Animal cells
16569	6	Exocytosis, when the waste exits the cell through the membrane.Endocytosis, when the food enters the cell throut the membrane.translation, when the membrane is surrounded and obsorbse the food.
16570	6	The first process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is that the cell membrane is selectivly permeable. The second process is having polar heads which attract water towards the cell. The third process is having nonpolar tails which repel water away from the cell. These processes help the cell bring nutrients in and waste out.
16571	6	cells use a nucleouse, a membrane, and organelles.
16572	6	They carry nutrients and proteins and give it energy
16573	6	Proteins make up the cell membrace. They only let in and out certain substances. There are 'tunnels' made out of amino acids that only let certain substances in and out.The cell membrane selectivly choooses which substances to let in and let out.
16574	6	Three proccesses used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis, meiosis, and cykinesis.
16575	6	active transport which requiers an enzyme to allow or disallow a substance into a cell. passive transport doesnt require an enzyme
16576	6	the cell membrane has structures that depending on the pressure in the cell itself, will either let in or secrete out substances such as food, waste or water
16577	6	anaphase, prohphase, telophase
16578	6	Passive transport moved things without energy from a low conentration to a high concentration.Active transport moves things with energy from a high to low concentration.Selective Permability means that the membrane allows some things to come through while others aren't allowed.Osmosis is a passive transport of water.Other passive transports include diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and ion channels.Active transports include the sodium potassium pump.
16579	6	passive, hyper tonic, hypo tonic
16580	6	Flagellum- A 'tail' on the cell that helps the cell to move around by whipping it around.Hair like structures- Tiny hairs on some cells that move around back and forth to give it as much motion as possiblePushing its' insides forward to give it a slime like appearence and move around.
16581	6	Cells control the movement of substances across the cell membrane by using osmosis and diffison and proteins in a cell.
16582	6	The 3 processes used by cells to control the movement is used by enzymes.
16583	6	One of the processes called, facilitated diffusion, is letting only some materials move into the cell by having a protein let in certain things. The second is the concentration gradient which lets smaller and less harmful materials into the cell which could be used as energy and power for the cell.  The third is the proteins that help move the bigger materials into or out of the cell with the channel protein.  This helps move the materials that normally cannot pass, be able to.
16584	6	Osmosis - the movement of a stubstance over a permiable membraneDiffusion -pinocytotic folding of the cell membrane - the cell wall splits and lets in the substance
16585	6	Cells have a selectivly permeable membrane. Meaning they controll what enter and leaves the cell. One way that cells bring in substances is through diffusion and osmosis. This is involuntery and requires no energy. Another way it with a carrier or channel protien this requires no energy if it is going with the concentration gradient. This is called passive transportation. The last way is again with a carrier or a channel protien, but it requires enegry because it is going against the concentraion gradient. This is called active transport.
16586	6	They slow down what ever is trying to get through other then blood. They help transport things. The cells nucleus tells the cell what not and what to do.

16588	6	Facilitaded diffusion, Active Transport, and Passive Transport.
16589	6	Three process's used by cells to control the movement are
16590	6	The membrane protein only allows certain things in the cell membrane and out.  Selectively premability only selects the good things that won't hurt the cell in.  The cholesteral let's the substances know what type of cell it is so they know which one to go to.
16591	6	transfer RNA which goes to other cells and helps them figure out what needs to be done.translation RNA which is the process of letting another cell know what to do.
16592	6	One way is osmosis, which allows water to pass through the membrane. This a passive transport, because no energy is used. if there is a higher concentration of water outside the cell, then water will pass into the cell.Another way is a pump. When a cell discharges one element, another element comes in to take its place. The cell uses energy for this process.
16593	6	Passive transport, active transport, and diffusion. Active transport uses engery. Passive transport does not ues engery. Diffusion is when the concentration from a higher area moves from concentraition from a lower area.
16594	6	Cells use osmosis to diffuse water across the cell membrane.Cells also use proteins and other enzymes to help move substances aross the membrane.Cells use diffusion to move substances through.
16595	6	One process used by cells to control movement of substance across the cell membrane is they can use presure and the flow to get were they need to be. Also another process used could be the blood stream to get cells across to membrane. Another way may be the process of useing other pbject or nutrients to get where they should be.
16596	6	They use ribosomes to move substances.  Cells also use the Golgi Apparatus to transport materials.  Lastly the cells use protein synthesis to move things across the cell.  It uses mRNA to send it and then tRNA to transfer it.
16597	6	osmosis is the diffusion of water over a semi-permeable membranea cell can engulf an organism using its cell membrane
16598	6	diffusion- through the cell membrane it brings things in and out.osmosis- absorbs nutrients

16602	6	They use flagellas to swim across the cell. They attach to the bigger moving substances. They go through passages in the cell.
16603	6	The three processes used by cells to control movement of the cell membrane is. Thats plants take in sunlight to absorb energy.  Also the cell wall helps protect the cell body.
16604	6	Cells use osmosis, the process of keeping concentrations of substances balanced, active transport, which uses energy from the cell to transport things in and out of the cell, and passive transport, which does not use the cell's energy to transport things in and out of the cell.
16605	6	The cell wall is around the outside of the cell and keeps substances moveing across the cell membrane and leaveing the cell and the cell wall helps keep everything in place.
16606	6	* The membrane lets the good thinggs in and the bad things out.  * It blocks the viruses from coming into the cells.* The golgi apperatus is like the messeneger that takes the things that need to leave to the membrane and the membrane lets them out.

16612	6	The cells have to package the substances, transport them to the part of the cell where their needed, and then they use them to help the cell in whatever way it needs it.
16613	6	Diffusion- movement of molecules with a higher concentration to a place with lower concentration.Facilitated Diffusion- equalizing the concentration Active Transport- when ATP is taking place
16614	6	It detects if the substance is bad or good for the cell before it enters.

16619	6	Food, Consuming, producing
16620	6	The cell membrane helps proteins and food come through to the nucleus and other organelles in the cell. It also helps proteins move through that are needed.

16628	6	Cells move waste particals across their membrane.
16629	6	Osmosis-that is when water goes through a semi permiable membrane.Diffusion-When substances like sugar or salt go through the cell membrane on the outside of the cell.
16630	6	mRNA-MessengertRNA-transportTrna-Transcript
16631	6	Cells are mRNA to bring information out of the molecules.
16632	6	Mitosis, cell diffusion, and Miosis.
16633	6	Diffusion- The substance spreads out from an area from high consentration to an area of lower consentration.Passive Transport- Substances follow with the consentration gradeanent using no energy.Active Transport- Substances follow againest the consentration gradenent using energy.
16634	6	Transport of substances across the cell membrane is a result of diffusion. Diffusion is the process of moving matter and materials from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
16635	6	Cell membrane does not allow anything that would be harmful to the cell in so it can not harm the plant. The cell membrane can also boot out any harmful microorganisms.
16636	6	The cell uses diffusion to uptain water. The cell uses endosytosis to control the intake of nurtients.The cell uses osmosis to regulate the cell.
16637	6	Use concentration gradient- if inside is less that outside than more moves in.Phospholipids- the head is polor tails nonpolar some items can not get inChannel proteins- Things that are to big to pass through membrane can pass through here.
16638	6	Passive Transport goes with the concentration gradient using tranport channels.Active Transport uses transport proteins to travel against the concentration gradient.Diffusion is the process where molecules enter the cell without using any energy.
16639	6	tRNA is a way of transfering things across the cell membrane.Another way of transporting materials is through the mRNA.The last way of transporting them is through the specific cell parts.

16642	6	One example is endocytosis, where a cell envelops something from the outside in its membrane which folds into a bubble that carries the material inside. Another is exocytosis, which is when a material leaving the cell is enveloped by the cell membrane and released from the cell in a bubble and the cell membrane closes behind it. There is also diffusion, which is when a material moves from the area of higher concentration outside the cell across the concentration gradient to an area of lower concentration inside the cell.
16643	6	Two would be the process of the transport protein and the channel protein to get substances across the membrane. Another process would be the cytoplasm that pushes certain nutrients through into the cell.
16644	6	Cells use processes like diffusion to transport particles to the cell membrance. They also use active transportation and transfusion to retrieve new particles.
16645	6	1. They help them move along by their jelly atmosphere.2. They move with the flow of bodily fluids and blood3.They use there 'tail' to project them furtherrr

16654	6	1.ATP is energy in a cell that moves across the cell membrane2.Osmosis or the water molcules are sent from the cell membrane3.Photosinthisis when the phase gets in the cell though the cell membrane
16655	6	The cell uses osmosis, the movement of substances from high concentration to low concentration. The cell uses protein channles to move substances that cannot pass through the cell membrane normaly. The cell uses diffusion to move material from areas of low concentration to high concentration. this is an example of active transport.
16656	6	Three proceeses used by the cell to control movement include, the cell membrance, and the cytoplasm. Which carry the substances around the cell. And the cell wall along with the cell membrane regulate what enters and leaves the cell.
16657	6	Division- the cell divide
16658	6	Three process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and cellular communication. They are all involved while trying to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
16659	6	Passive transport- requires no energy to transport substances.Active transport- requires energy to transport substances.Osmosis- moving water into and out of the cell.
16660	6	One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is active transport. Active transport is when the cell actively retrieves something that is needed, using ribosomes. Another is passive transport. Passive transport is when a substance simply passes through an opening in the cell membrane. A third way of moving a substance across the cell membrane is facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is when the substance moves with the concentration gradient through the cell membrane.
16661	6	They use proteins in order to keep the cell membrane active. And enzymes for the cell membrane always has protection from other diseases. Also homeostasis will be needed for the cell membrane to function properly.
16662	6	Osmosis, transport (active and passive), and facilitated diffusion. They use protiens to bring substances into the cell in a facilitated diffusion. This requires energy. In passive transport, substance like glucose naturally go into the cell because they are more concentrated in the outside. In osmosis, water enters and leaves the cells depending on the amount of water concentration in both sides of the membrane.
16663	6	RRNATRNAMRNA
16664	6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances include the mitochondria, which packages ribosomes, the nucleus to control the thought process, and the cell wall to protect the cell while controlling the substances.
16665	6	Osmosis is the diffusion of water into and out of the cell.  Endocytosis and Exocytosis are the entering and exiting of foods and wastes.  Diffusion in general is also used to bring molecules into and out of the cell through the membrane.
16666	6	1. The patassium ion gate only allows patassium ions through.2.Translation makes protiens go out attatch to this substance and bring it back across the membrane.3. Transcription only allows certain chemials to come in through the gate.
16667	6	*the Golgi Apparatus *the Endoplasmic Reticulm *the microtubuleThese are the three most important processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. All three processes work in different ways to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.The Golgi Apparatus oversees what goes in and out the cell. This heplps regulate the movement of substances.The Endoplasmic Reticulm cleans out the cell and protects the cell from anything thats not suppose to happen in the cell.The microtubule regulates the movement of substances by allowing only so much substances to in the cell.
16668	6	They use Messanger RNA to send messages through the cell. They also use Receptor RNA to recive messages that other parts of the cell send to the receptor RNA.  They also use transfer RNA to transfer DNA and other things that need to get across the cell.
16669	6	The Cytoplasm enables things to be moved through out the cell, because it is a jelly like sustance.The cell membrane keep bad things out of the cell and it lets good things into the cell.The endoplasmic reticulum carries ribosomes.
16670	6	1. The structures move throughout the cytoplasm.2. Flagellum, a whip-like structure that helps move the organism.3. The organelles help the cell to funtion.
16671	6	1. Osmosis- The movement of water through a membrane.  It is a form of passive transport.2. Diffusion- The movement of particles through a membrane using passive transport.3. Active Transport- The movement of particles through a membrane through protiens that requires energy.
16672	6	foodwaterair
16673	6	One process the cell uses to control the movement of substances across the membrane is by using mitocondria to transport materials. The Nucleus tells which organism to move at a certain time.
16674	6	1.the cell being polar allows only certain substances to travel across the cell membrane.2.the cell creates a cell wall, which protects the organelles and other things found in the cell.3. nuclear pores allow only certain things to enter from the membrane into the nucleus
16675	6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport which activley or uses energy to move things across the mebrane, osmosis which does not use energy moves water across the membrane, and diffusion which moves things without energy where there is a lot of it to a space where there is not as much of it.
16676	6	Three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cells membrane are telophase, metaphase, autophase.
16677	6	One process that is used to control the movement of substances is active transportation.This allows an evenly flow of substances to move in and out of the cell membrane. Another process is diffusion. This is when a substances is allowd to move freely through the cell membrane. The last process is passive transport. This is when a substances is alloud to move though the cell membrane unfrequently and uneaqually.
16678	6	One of the processes is miosis. One more process is mitosis. The last process is homeostasis.
16679	6	one way is what the cell might eatanother is if it gets enough energy.and last way is if it get enough oxygen.
16680	6	They walk, use flagellum, or their sessile.

16682	6	The flagulla helps its movement.
16683	6	cells move across the cell in 3 different ways, they can move by creating other cells from cellsthe can move by blood flow
16684	6	Osmosis-Where water is used to pass the substances through the cell membrane.Diffusion-Where the substances diffuse across the cell membrane.Active Transport-Where the substance activally passes through the cell membrane.
16685	6	The fallagleum helps the cell move with the wips at the end of each cell. The cell memebrane also helps a cell move as wel as give it shape.
16686	6	letting waste outSplitting into more cells Having a mitocondrian
16687	6	Cells help the body maintain function. It helps move blood cells around ur body. Without cels you could be alive.
16688	6	The cell could use the function of a selective permeable membrane and the use of transport proitens to move substances across the cell against diffusion. The cell could also use its organelles such as its vacuole(s) to control what comes in and out of the cell.
16689	6	Cells use flagella and cilia to be able to move.
16690	6	The cell uses two types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane. The first is passive transport; this can be used both with and without transport proteins. Both kinds of passive transport are with the concentration gradient, which means the process requires no energy. The third process and the second type of transport is active transport. This occurs against the concentration gradient, and uses transport proteins.
16691	6	Exocytosis is when the cell membrane engulfs the material exiting the cell and pushes it out.Endocytosis is when the cell membrane absorbs the material entering the cell and draws it in.Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane.
16692	6	mailing, sending, and receving
16693	6	Osmosis; the diffusion of water across the membrane allows the movement of substances across the cell membrane.Homeostasis can allow the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
16694	6	ozmoses, selictive membrane, and something elce?
16695	6	The cell membrane will only let certain things across because only certain things can fit. Also when something is too big, the cell can use energy to transport it.
16696	6	Diffusion allow minerals and other substances into the cell without using energy.Facilitated Diffusion is when the cell membrane has to use energy to help the substance move through the cell membrane.Osmosis allows water to enter the cell using high/low pressure.
16697	6	1. Cells can group together maximizing surface area making a stronger unit.2. Cells can move around to decrease the movement of substances across it.3. Cells can also pair up with different kinds of organisms that move.

16700	6	One is homeostatis and it controls the inner temperature of the cell. A second one is semiosis and it removes excess salt from the cell. i cant remember the last one.
16701	6	active transport-carrier molecules pull the different molecules through the membrane of the celldiffusion-the process of molecules moving from areas of high concentration to low concentration to equalize the amount in each areaosmosis-a special form of diffusion that involves only the transport of water
16702	6	transcripttranslation
16703	6	One process that the cell uses to control the movement of substances is active transportation, where you have to be moving to get the energy you need to make it move. Another process is passive transportation, where you do not need energy to make it move. The last process is the parts of the cell that go in and out of the cell, and bring back nutrients.
16704	6	There is meiosis, mitosis, and last osmosis. Meiosis is have one cell seperate in two seperate ones. Mitosis is having the two cells seperate again. Osmosis is having the proteins get moved from one side to another.
16705	6	three processes used by cells to control the movement are
16706	6	gliding/ glides across the cell.flaguem/ a little roter that spins to move.moving/ acually moving and nothing else helping.
16707	6	Diffusion- they release waste and take waste in so that the cell can live.Exertion
16708	6	1.the cells help the cell membrane move bby collecting sugars2.they control part of the cell membrane3.it activates the cell membrane
16709	6	One way is that they would stop  the substance and use it for energy. A second way is that they send messages to what controls the substance to tell when to move. A third way is that they each have a different function that will control different parts of the substance.
16710	6	The three that control movement are active transport because this uses energy. Another one is passive transport, and this one doesnt use energy and it can survive easier.
16711	6	osmosis- process of moving things in and out of the cell.Mitohcondria- move proteins across the cell Golgi body- package and sort protiens in the cell and send them to disired places.
16712	6	DIFFUSION,REMOVING WASTES,MOVENT THROUGH BODY
16713	6	diffusion- movement of a substance from high to low concentrationosmosis- movement of water through a bembrane from hogh to low concentrationfacillitated diffusion -movement of a larger substance through protien chanals on the cell membrane
16714	6	Smaller substances are able to go through the cell membrane.
16715	6	Cells use ribosomes and cytoplasm to transfer information from a host cell to the nucleus.
16716	6	Cells use diffusion to move molecule from area of high concentration to area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.  They use osmosis to move water to and from the cell.  Finally, cells use active transport to move larger molecules useing energy from ATP.
16717	6	Cells use their genetic information to move across membranes.
16718	6	They use active transport, passive transport, and they use facilitated transport.
16719	6	Diffusion-  particle move around randomlyOsmosis- water moves aroundMolecular transport that require mitochondria that release ATP  through cellular respiration.
16720	6	One process is taking in the different materials, called endocells. Another is getting rid of materials by exocells. Other cells transfer material from one part of the organism to another part, transfer cells.
16721	6	The cell membrane is selectively permeable, so it controls what substances come in and what comes out. Also certain proteins carry the substance to where it is supposed to go. Finally, the cell takes out any waste or material that doesn't need to be there
16722	6	Three processes that cells use to control movement are: the cell membrane, the nucleus, and the cell wall if it is a plant cell. The cell membrane controls what substances enter and leave the cell. The nucleus helps transport materials across the cell membrane. The cell wall in a plant cell also acts like the cell membrane, it controls what materials enter and leave the cell.
16723	6	The endoplasmic reticulumThe RibosomesThe nucleus
16724	6	The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning that only certain substances are allowed inside the cell. The moving of particles in and out of the cell is called diffusion. The movement of water in and out of the cell is called osmosis.
16725	6	The cell wall controls one of the substances across the cell membrane.
16726	6	Mutation, mRNA and, tRNA
16727	6	gentic drift
16728	6	They use a vesicle to transport these from one side to another. They also use flagela to help the movement of the cells.Cilia is another use to help the cell move.

16731	6	One process used by cells to control movemnet of subtance across their membrane is something to help them stay safe from outside threats, another will help them decide what to do ater they found out if the outside thing is a threat, and the other is where the protein regultor looks over ones who come in.
16732	6	Cells use three types of movment. One of them is osmosis. This is where water is transferred through the cell membrane. The second is active transportation. This is where the cell is required to use energy to diffuse some substances through the membrane. The third one is passive transportation. This is where the celll diffuses substances through the membrane just my using its movement to push the substances through.
16733	6	nucleus
16734	6	Cells control the movement of substance across the cell membrane by:     1)blocking substance     2)protection of the membrane     3)whenever the cell has to deposit bad substance or material
16735	6	one is that the cell has something that tells it to control it 's movement of substances so it can move safely across the cell membrane.two is that the cell always go's through the membrane so it nows what to do when it gets to that point to crose it and finaly three the cell and the membrane are connected so they know what to do with eachother in the body.
16736	6	Active Transport- Moving substances from a low to high concentrationPassive Transport-Moving substances from a high to low concentrationOsmosis-When the cells go through the wall with water
16737	6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are cellular respiration, movement of the cell and protein synthesis of the cell.
16738	6	Three of the processes are using miosis. The next process is using mitosis. The last process is using nondisjunction.
16739	6	Diffusion,Diffusion controls the amount of water that can enter or leave the cell.  If the cell does not have the correct amount of water, it will not be able to survive
16740	6	Active transport, Diffusion, and Osmosis. Active transport transports the protiens. Diffusion moves water low concentration to high concentration. Osmosis is high to low
16741	6	Cells use processes such as the help of the golgi apparatus to help successfully transport proteins around the cell membrane in order for protein synthesis to occur. Also, a cell is very complex and organized with all the cell parts, this ensures that when substances move around the cell on tracks that they arrive effectively. Another process is through the plasma membrane it controls the movement in and out of the cell with the cell wall and help everything moving in the cytoplasm run well. All movement goes through the golgi apparatus. It is like a mail system it packages and sends the substances throughout the cell.
16742	6	nucleic acids, protiens, and amino acids
16743	6	I'm geussing blood flow.
16744	6	1.One of the processes used my cells to control the movement of substances is through the plasma membrane. The membrane filters what goes in and comes out of a cell.2.Another is when the DNA moves across the cell by splitting and reataching to another part of DNA. 3.The last is through te cell wall for plants. The cell wall also helps filter what goes in and comes out of plant cells.
16745	6	water passes through the membrane. they membrane releases waste. it gets nutrients through the membrane.
16746	6	they use the nucleus to send messages which help they also use the cytoplasm to transfer
16747	6	anaphase, is when the substance is starting to move.Transition, is when it is being pushed to the next phase.Telekinesis, is where the substance makes it through the membrane.
16748	6	1. DIFFUSION2.3.
16749	6	1) The cells move with the membrane to help it move easier. 2) The cells move opposite of the membrane's movement to help      it move more efficiently.3) The cell absorbes and digests the substances and spreads it        throghout the membrane.
16750	6	Prophase which leads to anaphase that leads to interphase.
16751	6	There are three processes that a cell can go through to move substances across a cell's membrane, such as: passive transport, active transport, and diffusion. Passive transport is when substances are moved with the concentration gradient. Active transport goes against the concentration gradient and uses transport proteins along with tunnels in the cell's membrane. Diffusion is when particles inside a cell move from an area of high concentration to low concentration.
16752	6	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are chains of dna, through reactants,and photosynthesis.
16753	6	The first process is using a phuedofoot, the cell extends the itself and pulls itself along.The next way is by a flangellum whics is a whip-like structure.And finally the cell can have little silla around its membrane that move.
16754	6	Phagocytosis - The cell will bring in larger objects, typically food, throught the cell membrance by having the cell membrane envolpe it and pinch off releasing the substance on the inside of the cell and not leaving a hole in the cell membranePinocytosis - Similair to phagocytosis, but with smaller substances and liquids.Osmosis - Water in or around the cell will flow to the area with less water.
16755	6	Passing it through the membrane, sending it through cells to be transported, and letting it flow through
16756	6	Three process  used by cells to control the movement across the cell memebrane are active transport which is when the cell moves materials in an opposite direction against the consintation gradient.diffusion is the movement of particals through a concentation gradient. Another is passive transport consit of a chemical substance across a cell membrane without energy.
16757	6	Transcription, translation, digestion
16758	6	diffusion,passive transport, active transport
16759	6	The cells have a wide surface area to allow substances to pass through them. They also have functions that help their movement. The cells have certain phases that allow the movement of substances.
16760	6	Cells have cell walls and membranes which determine what enter/exit the cell and what does not, and also it identifies what is trying to enter/exit the cell.
16761	6	Osmosis: from one area of high concentration to low concentration; or from low to high; or equal on both sidesBinary Fission: when the channnel protein is used to pass nutrients into the cell.Faculative Diffusion: when nutrients are diffusing through the cell.
16762	6	Cells use diffusion to transport substances across the cell membrane. Diffusion is when a substance is moved through a selectivly permeable membrane using energy.Cells also use osmosis to move water across the membrane. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectivly permeable membrane.

16776	6	the falagula is a whip like structure that helps the cell move. the fluid around the cell helps it move.
16777	6	One process by which cells control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is by the flagella which moves the cell. The celia moves the cell, and the plasma moves the cell.
16778	6	tRNA&mRNA are the transportation of DNA. Ribosomes are constantly being travel around the cell.

16785	6	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are, osmosis which uses water to move things in or out of the cell. Proteins, they help transport things to other parts of the cell, and lipids they help let important things inside and outside of the cell.
16786	6	cytoplasm
16787	6	Cells use processes such as diffusion, osmosis, and one other process to move water across the cell membrane.
16788	6	Diffusion is movement of particles from high concentration to low concentration through a semi-permeable membrane.Osmosis is the diffusion of water.Active Transport requires energy and is the movement of particles from low concentration to high concentration.
16789	6	they pass things that are not neededthey pass thing to adiffrent type of cell that may need it to function rightit might send something bad and then have to go fix it so it doesnt go to bad so the lysomes will do that
16790	6	The active transport, the passive transport, and the fusion.
16791	6	there are three processes that take substances accross the membrane, and they are osmosis, active transport, and diffusion.  each of them have to do with water and keeping each side of the membrane even with water and other substances.  reaching equilibreum means that both sides are even in water and substances, sometimes water moves from an areea of high concentration to an area of low concentration, and some times it goes from low concentration to high concentration.
16792	6	diffusion, active transport and passive transport
16793	6	To move substances across the cell membrane the cell has to go through cell differntiation. It is also easier for a substance to move across the cell with its flagellum.
16794	6	Anitbodies- protect the homeostasis of the body are used to control the movement of substancesWhite Blood Cells fight agianst unknown substances as well.The body's proccss of becoming immune to viruses is also a control to protect the body from substances.

16796	6	1enter the membrane23
16797	6	Three processes the cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the following: electron transport train, cellular respiration, and  passive transport.The electron transport train moves proteins by attaching to other substances. Cellular respiration breaks down glucose and moves it across the cell by using energy.Passive transport does not use energy and it moves the substances across the cell.
16798	6	One of the threee processes used by the cell would be mitochondria. Also there would be protien witch gives the cell energy. The last one would be oxygen or carbon so the cell can live and breath.
16799	6	anaphase telophase metaphase
16800	6	RND and DNA RNA brings protens back to the nucles
16801	6	Three processes a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be the cytoplasm which would direct where the material went, the organelles would also control the movement to see if it was directed towards them, and the nucleus and nuclear membrane so the material wont enter into the nucleus.
16802	6	it has to be from the same plant animal ect..it cannot be from a different place od the cellit could be from anything
16803	6	Diffusionand Osmosis
16804	6	The golgi aparatis helps move subtances through the cell.  The endoplasmic reticulum moves ribosomes and the cytoplasm holds it in place and moves substances through it.
16805	6	Passive Transport is a way a cell helps control the movement of substances across the membrane.  It is the movement of substances without the use of energy.  Another process is active transport.  It is the movement of substances across the membrane with the use of energy.  Osmosis is another process that helps control the movement of substances.  It is the movement and diffusion of water.
16806	6	1. Osmosis is when molecules move from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration.2.Passive transport moves molecules across the cell without using energy.3. Active transport moves molecule across the cell by using energy.
16807	6	Cells use diffusion of water and substanced from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Cell membranes keep out invading substances. Cell walls also do this and allow objects to move across the membrane.
16808	6	Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are; diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Diffusion does not use enegergy to move substances across the cell membrane while facilitated diffusion and osmosis need enegry to do the task.
16809	6	Cellular RespirationTranscription Translation
16810	6	The mRNA sends messages to the other side of the cell membrane. The tRNA transports things. The rRNA is the ribosomal RNA.

16812	6	Transfer RNA (tRNA) holds the genetic code for protein making, so they move around and go to the mitochondria.Golgi Apparatus has tubes that carry matrials around in it.Sacoules hold materials that are needed later on and move to transport.
16813	6	1: the E.R. is like a waterway to help stuff move out and in the cell.
16814	6	osmossis is used to move the cells across the membrane.
16815	6	Photosynthesis is a process where the cell makes food for the species. There is chemosynthesis where the cell makes chemicals needed for the cell. Materials enter and leave the cell membrane through the lipid bilayer.
16816	6	Osmosis is the movement of a substance, particulary water, from a high to low concentration. There are three types of osmosis, being; hypotonic -ower concentration, hypertonic- meaning higher concentration, and equilibrium - where both the substance surrounding the cell have the same concentration. This controls the movement of substances across a cell membrane. Substances pass through the cell membrane through vesicles, or air gaps, in the membrane.
16817	6	Passive Transport- when cells dont need help moving this throughActive Transport- When the cell needs help moving things though it.

16823	6	Photoshynthisis is one was to make sure calls get there nutriens.Difusion is a way to get water across the cell. Homeostasis is when your body shivers or sweats to maintain a balenced internal core temperature.
16824	6	they use the body
16825	6	Osmosis is a process where particles move through the membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Diffusion is a process where particles move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentraion. Active transport is the process where
16826	6	The cell takes the substance and separates it from the rest of the cell. Then the substance is moved through the membrane through small hole or pore like areas.
16827	6	homeostasis- it keeps the cell balanced with the same amount of water on the inside as on the outsidethe cell membrane separates to let some things in and it keeps other things outosmosis
16828	6	Osmosis is used by cells when moving through water. Active transport is used by cells when going from a lower concentration to a higher concentration. Diffusion is used by cells when going from a higher concentration to a lower concentration.
16829	6	One process would be osmosis, which is the movement of water across a cell, that is how some cells control movement. Another process would be to use pseudopodia (false feet) to gain control of substances. The third process would be to use a mouth-like part.
16830	6	The first step is interphase in which the cells are separated. The next step is antaphase in which the cells start to form together. And finally, the last step is telephase where the two cells become one.

16836	6	Cells use active transport which uses energy to get rid or take in substances with the use of energy, passive transport which does not use energy to move things in or out of the cell, and exocytosis is the process of moving things out of the cell such as waste.
16837	6	Cell membrane regulates what goes in and out, golgi body separates what is good and bad, the endoplasmic reticulum escorts the bad things out of the cell.
16838	6	Flagella's, membrane walls, and cell chains
16839	6	The cell splits, divdies, and creates two new cells.
16840	6	Selective permibility; It's like a screen it only lets certain things in or out.The pores in the membrane; They act like a dam, only letting in things at certain times.
16841	6	They use osmosis, which is the controll of how much water is absorbed or transfered out of the cell.They use hydrophobic lipids to control the input/ output
16842	6	they could use diffusion.they could use energy to difuse it over
16843	6	Passive is when things move over them membrane.Endcytosis is when nutrients are taken into the cell.Exocytosis is when waste is released from the cell.
16844	6	the membrane breakes down substances to pass through the wall, and controls size
16845	6	The cell wall keeps things from entering and leaving the cell.
16846	6	Substances are moved out of the cell membrane by 'guards' that make sure nothing harmful is lead into the cell.
16847	6	Facilitated diffusion, simple diffusion, spacital diffusion, are the three processes that controll movement in to and out of the cell through the call membrane.
16848	6	Osmosis
16849	6	nucleous controls the whole cell and move around by proteins
16850	6	-one process is how mitochondria helps make proteins and travel them about the cell-another process is how the nucleus is the life line for the cell-another process is having the proteins travel out of the cell and into the cell membrane
16851	6	Cell diffusion helps molecules randomly move in and out of cells.  Passive transport helps smaller cells pass through other cells. Active transport helps moves larger cells and requires energy.
16852	6	The membrane restricts some things from coming through. On animal cells a cell wall restricts what comes in and out of the cell.
16853	6	Active transport: The cell uses energy to move something from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentraion.Deffusion: The movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low conentration.
16854	6	One process used to control movement of substances across the cell membrane would be the flageum.It moves the substances from one place to another. The second would be the liquid substance inside the cell membrane. The third process is...
16855	6	The many different processes inside a cell are divided into 3 definite types. I forget what their called, but one uses the pores inside the cell's membrane/skin. Another uses the cells inside the cell, such as tiny moving markers/beings. The last process is when the cell lets in or lets out substances. Which are controled.

16863	6	CiliaFlagella
16864	6	Cells use diffusion to move across the the membrane.
16865	6	The three processes that are use to move molecules across the cell membrane are active transport, and passive transport.In active transport, energy is needed to move particals across the cell membrane. This is possible with the protein channel (in the lipid bilayer) opening up the top and alowing the molecule to come in and then sqeezing the molecule out into the cell.Passive transport doens't not require enegry. Particals that are small enough just pass through the cell membrane to maintain homiostasis (or create en equal amount of the particles on each side of the membrane).
16866	6	One process is the semi-permiable membrane that surrounds the nucleus. RNA and other materials may pass through. Another process is the cell membrane that surrounds the entire cell. Water and nutrients may enter the cell while waste is moving out of it. Also, some organisms may have a cell wall surounding the cell membrane.
16867	6	meiosis-mitosis-cells splits into 2 daughter cells
16868	6	Osmosis is where the water  can pass right through the membrane. Defussion is when the cell reaches equalibreum to pass through the membrane. The third process called cell deffussion is when the cell has to get help to pass through the membrane
16869	6	a cell gets reed of waste and material through its cell membrane.it can copy its dna to make a offspring through its cell memebrane.it also use it cell membrane to move back and fourth and side ways
16870	6	The cell wall help to protect bad things from getting in.-when something bad enters the body through the mouth, sore, nose, and ect. the body works as one to make sure that the bad cells get out.
16871	6	Osmosis- The movement of water to a different place in the cell where it is needed.Diffusion- The movement of a substance from a level of higher concentration to a level of lower concentration.Exocytosis- The movement of unneeded material and wastes out of the cell.
16872	6	One way cells control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is through the use of enzymes that are alerted when to let the cell membrane become permeable. Another way is through osmosis, which is when water moves across the permeable membrane. Other substances can move across the membrane during this, also. Another way, is the cell wall, in plant cells. It allows nothing to get through to the cell unless enzymes tell it to.
16873	6	they use there cell wall to control what enters and exits the cell, same with the cell membrane, and the mRNA helps regulate what goes in and out
16874	6	1)Interphase: where they crack in two.2)Telophase: Where they split apart3)Anaphase: Where they produce more.
16875	6	cells move the substances to other cells.those cells deliver the substance to the nucleus.the nucleus spreads the substance across the cell membrane
16876	6	The cytoplasm helps things to swim around the cell.The contracting organelles push things around.Some organelles carry things where they need to go.
16877	6	the cell uses ribosomes the rough indoplasmic recticulum and the smooth endoplasmic recticulum
16878	6	Cells protect and help with growth and reproduction.
16879	6	Binary fission, conjugation, respiration
16880	6	They have openings in their membranes that allow some things to go through. They have special organs that help move the wastes the cell makes. the protiens that are made are moved by the endoplasmatic reticulum.
16881	6	they use the flagella to move across the cell.
16882	6	The cell wall which is a barrier, and the mitocondria which will destroy it.
16883	6	Three processes are diffussion, osmosis, and endocytosis.
16884	6	There are three types ofprocesses that can be used.One process is cell reproduction.
16885	6	1) Photosythesis helps plant reproduce.2) Glycolysis helps to produce sugar.3) The Krebs Cycle helps to keep eveything in line.
16886	6	tRNA, mRNA, rRNA
16887	6	meiosismitosiscell cycle
16888	6	the cell sends messages to the body.
16889	6	1.The cell has a selective permeable membrane that decides what enters and leaves the cell.2.The cell has proteins that transports substances along the cell membrane.
16890	6	The cell uses cytoplasm, the golgi apparatus, and the mitochondria to help move substances around.
16891	6	1. the ER and ribosomes2. the flagella3. the mitochondria.
16892	6	Organelles use Flagella to worm thier way through the Cell. The Cell Membrane has little ways to let good things in and keep the bad things out. The nucleus controls all the movement within the cell.
16893	6	the cell uses lysosomes, prokayotes, and proteins to move things across the cell membrane
16894	6	The cell wal lets certain things enter and other not enter. It knows wat is good and bad.The nucleus contorls cell activity and it tell substances where to go. The vacualles surve as storage sacs so it can keep nutrient in the cell.
16895	6	The distribution of a gene, sharing enzimes, and sharing protines
16896	6	1) Cells are the basic unit of life.2) Everything exists with cells.3) Cells are the main functioning of the body.

16898	6	1. Flegilla2. Nucleus3. Mitosis
16899	6	The cell wall helps control what comes in and out.The mitochondria clean up and help control the movement.The Golgi Apparatus removes unwanted or dead substances from the cell membrane.
16900	6	osmosis- the movement of water.cell wall- barrier that helps control which substances cross.Most substances have to be selectively permeable in order to cross a barrier.
16901	6	Three processes are prophase, metaphase, and telephase. Prophase begins to separate the cell as the nucleus disappears, meatphase is where the cell splits in half, and telephase is where the cells become new daughter cells.
16902	6	The cells use flagelluims to control the flow of movement, cells have the flagellums move the bad stuff out to the cell membane and the cell membrane moves the bad stuff to the cell wall.
16903	6	The cell attachs to the DNA. The cell then moves to the RNA. The cell then moves across the membranes.
16904	6	The three processes are transfer DNA, messneger DNA, and RNA.

16910	6	1. mRNA
16911	6	One process is the soduim-potassuim pump. This pump allows hoemestasis within the cell. Allowing the cell to move 3 sodium ions outstide of the cell then allowing 2 potassuim ions inside of the cell. A second process in endocytosis. This process streches the cell membrane out and forms around the substances making a vesicle. Then this vesicle will transport the substance to the correct place in the cell. Lastly, a third process would be the ion channels. These channels are opened by a signal molecule that knows when an ions must be passed in or out of the cell. Then when ions are not being passed through the channel a gate closes the channel not allowing substances to go neither in nor out.
16912	6	The E.R. moves material.The golgi aperatus uses a push pull type method.Ribosomes carry information along the process.
16913	6	when they produce suger and when they get the protien they need, they move it to where they want it by how they get it.
16914	6	Cells use passive transport and active transport to move material across the cell and they also use osmosis to transport liquids from one part of the cell to the other.
16915	6	By changing the dna to make it right so that it does not cause a problem.Another way is by not letting something bad get threw to the cell membraneand harming it.
16916	6	Active transport allows the cell to let in materials by using the cell's energy.
16917	6	selective permiability - the membrane can decide what goes in and what goes out.
16918	6	Cells use diffision to transport water in and out of a cell to balence the pressure.
16919	6	The first one is when they need to begin life as a single cell.The second one is when they need to have the same information just like some of the rest do.The third one is when they need to do the right thing and that is be in human bodies.

16924	6	The cell has an outer coating on the nuecleus, the  cell has an outer coating on the membrane
16925	6	THE NUCLEUS HELPS MOVE STUFF THROUGH THE CELL_
16926	6	the cells will use the blood stream, the brain, and the cells
16927	6	They use selective permeability which selects what substances get in and out, active transport which requires movement and creates an opening for substances to move, and passive transport which doesn't require movement of cells to move substances.
16928	6	The cell membrane is selective. This means that the cell membrane always only certain amterials to enter and leave the cell. This also provides protection of the cell.      Active transportation is also used. It transfer substances along gradient concentrated parts while using energy.      Passive transporation is the same except it does not use energy as active transportation does.
16929	6	the cells pick up the imfromation and it is carried through out the body.

16938	6	The golgi apparatus is used to bloke fluids. The mitocondrian is used to excrete bad fluids from the cell membrane. The cell wall is used to protect the cell membrane and keep the good fluids inside the cell membrane.
16939	6	Osmosis is used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane by controling what goes out of the cell.Diffusion also controls what goes out of the cell.
16940	6	1. They allow water to cross through 2. They keep some viruses out3. They let oxygen & corbon Monoxide out
16941	6	The nucleus of the cell regulates what goes on inside. The messenger RNA is what sends messages to the different parts of the cell, so they know what to do. The transfer RNA helps the messenger RNA out.
16942	6	The cell uses osmosis to move substances around the cells. The cell also uses organelles inside the cell to move substances around. Another way they move substances around is increasing and decreasing the water pressure in and outside of the cell.
16943	6	They could use Meosis, Mitosis, or

16946	6	they use proteins to move quickly
16947	6	The movement of cells are controled by cytoplasm, the gell-like floor in the cells that holds the organelles in place. Proteins help everything moving along in the cell membrane also. THe calls membrane is also moved by rhibosomes, they make the proteins, which help the membrane.
16948	6	One process used to control the movement of substances is filtration. Another is using the mitocondria for memory if the substance has every been in the cells before. The last process is using the chemicals in a cell to test what the substance is and it decides to keep it or not.
16949	6	Cells use osmosis which is where there isn't an equilibrium between the cell and its environment so nutrients and other substances diffuse into the cell and waste and other materials diffuse out until an equilibrium is found. Diffusion is where nutrients diffuse into the cell from the outside environment and waste diffuses out of the cell. This requires the use of energy. Active Transport is where the cell goes out and forcibly takes in nutrients and lets waste out through the use of transport proteins and pores in the cell memebrane. This requires the use of energy.
16950	6	One process is mutation.Another process is spreading of cells.

19353	7	Rose can talk to people and tell them how she realy feels about everything that is happening in her life.
19354	7	Rose is very responsible and accepts her challenges. When she is talking to Anna she excepts the fact that they have to work to help support their brother through collage so that he can have a better life and in turn support them through collage.
19355	7	Cambodia is the country that Rose came from. It is diffucult for Rose because she grew up in the United States and was born in Cambodia.
19356	7	Rose gets very stressed by all of the things she has to do to help her family, work, and school.
19357	7	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna would be troubled. Her dad is off at college and she has a three-thousand-word essay to right. She is probabley stressed out.
19358	7	Rose was very worried by the end of the story. The dream had upset her. I can see that when the story mentioned that Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream.
19359	7	Rose is having a diffcult time adjusting, and is unsure about a lot.  I feel like Rose is a girl that cares what people think of her, and thats why she feels the way she does. And the conversation with her Aunt she really tries to tell her other people don't matter, as long as you have family.
19360	7	Rose is a goood girl that wants to help but feels like she is giving up her life in the prosess.
19361	7	Rose does not like to hurt people's feelings. (Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.)
19362	7	When it comes to others, one trait Rose has is that she can set aside how she feels to try and make others feel better, like when she was putting her own stress aside to make her sister Anna feel better.
19363	7	Rose is worried. She hears from her sister that money isn't everything. Her aunt says that she does see where Rose is coming from. Rose is very exhausted from working on school and at work.
19364	7	she cares about her family, because when her aunt asked do she feel weighed down  by the doining she do for the family, she didnt answer but she did want to say something its jus she didnt want to hurt her aunt
19365	7	She is very suspicious.
19366	7	Rose holds things in to avoid conflict. You can see this when she hides what she is thinking from Anna and doesn't respond to her Aunt in order to avoid hurting her feelings.
19367	7	She feels very weighed down by the family, because she's always working and going to school and then going home to cook dinner for the family.
19368	7	I believe that Rose is very patient with Anna. When the two girls started to argue, Anna became very upset and did not handle the situation very well. Even when Rose disagreed with Anna or expressed that she felt annoyed by some of the things Anna was saying, she still kept her tone of voice low and did not scream or shove anything. She is understanding of other people's feelings and thoughts and even though she might not agree on the topic, she knows how to handle herself.
19369	7	1.) One trait is that Rose wants to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize, but she can't.1.) One detail is that Rose already had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.
19370	7	Worried, she worried that Paul will get hurt. She's worried because he's away and theres nothing she can do about it.
19371	7	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with her Aunt Kolba is that she cares about what other people think, and she doesn't like to hurt peoples feelings. She is also worried about her mom, and doesn't want to upset her either.Paragraph 19- 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
19372	7	I would say Rose is optimistic. In paragraph eleven, Rose says to Anna that he will get a good job and pay for both Anna and Rose to go to college.
19373	7	One trait is that Rose takes after her mother.' Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table. ' You sound just like Mama.'...
19374	7	Rose cares deeply for her sister Anna and her Aunt Kolab. A way she shows it is that she did not want to tell her Aunt the truth about how she feels weighed down by all the work she is doing that keeps her so busy because it would hurt her Aunt's feelings.
19375	7	She is very responsible but feels she has to much to handle. When she has the conversation with Anna she rolls her eyes and shoved her self away from the table and said you sound like Mama
19376	7	I believe that she has a good sense family.  She is helping pay for her brother to go to college and is helpin with responsibilities at home.
19377	7	Rose has a strong sense of determination in her. She is determined to help her brother get through college, eventhough she is in the midst of her own life. She has school, work, and family commitments to tend to, yet still strives for more in writing an essay for the contest. She is determined to help her family in any way she can, even if it means sacrificing something of her herself.
19378	7	Rose a very sensative, sympathetic kind person. For one the way she tlaksabout her dad and how she has missed him so much because he's been gone for four months. She's also very good about being a good listener and talking back to the other person. She has feelings and lets them out when needed she doens't bottle everything up.
19379	7	A trait that Rose has is feeling over burdened. When she slpt, she dreamed that Paul weighed her down in the water and it relates to her in real life. That she feels weighed down because she is being asked a lot of.
19380	7	Rose can be described as hard-working. Rose goes to school for 8 hours then go work at a four hour job. Rose went home after that to help her aunt cook a quick supper, then she can do her homework. She then has to find enough time to type a three-thousand-word essay. She is real busy and works hard to make sure they get done.
19381	7	One trait to describe Rose would have to be selfcomfident. Because Rose believes that even though Paul is never home, that it is for a good cause so Rose and Anna can both get into college.
19382	7	A trait that Rose has based on her conversations would be that she is very hard working, doesn't give up easily, and is very thankful for everything others do for her. She talks about how her brother must feel knowing they are relying on him to send them to college. During this she seems to feel very thankful but also somewhat guilty.
19383	7	Rose is very determined, because although she has been exhausted  she is still willing to work and she even writes the three thousand word essay.
19384	7	One trait that describes Rose is compassionate. When Rose's aunt asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help this family, Rose didn't answer because she stated that she didn't want to hurt her aunts feelings which shows that she does care about how she affects the family.
19385	7	She dosent really like her life, and doesnt appricate what her family does for each other.'i hate how she has to work so late.'
19386	7	I believe that the one trait that describes Rose the most is how she tries to do everything perfect and make everyone happy, when really, she is the one that isn't happy. She is a perfectionist. The example that makes me think this way is in the first paragraph when she said that she went to school, straight to work, home to help with dinner, and then still makes time to do her homework.
19387	7	She is a very determined girl.
19388	7	One character trait she has is compassion for family members.  She decided not to say anything to her anut because it might of hurt her anut.
19389	7	She tries to always keep a positive thought on the outside even if she doesn't feel that way on the inside, to keep other peoples spirits lifted even if she can't lift her own
19390	7	The trait that can best describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is altruistic. Rose is very altruistic when she selflessly considers the feelings of her aunt and her mother and decides not tell Aunt Kolab the truth about how she feels weighed down by how she helps her family.
19391	7	Rose is a very detrimined girl, she likes to get thing done and not put them off. like in paragragh two it says she went from school, to work, to home to fix dinner, and do homework.
19392	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is exhausted. She's not just exhausted in the literal sense but shes tired of her lifestyle. She wants to be able to live a life without worries and pressure all of the time. One detail from the text is in paragraphs 18-19. It states that she is weighed down from all of the pressure to help her family. Anna is tired of this pressure but she knows she can not hurt her Aunt.
19393	7	Rose is determined, but also conflicted. She feels weighed down by all her responsibilities, but cares deeply about being successful, and making her parents proud. She is very determined to be the best she can be. We see that she cares deeply for her family, and determined to succeed as her brother did by her flashback memory. She wants her parents to be proud of what she has accomplished, and is determined to get through these rough times in her life to become successful, as her brother did the day he got his diploma.
19394	7	In her conversation to Anna, Rose was compassionate toward her sister. Rose asked Anna is she was feeling okay; however, Anna was unkind back.
19395	7	she trying to love her family and take care of tham
19396	7	In this story, one trait I can describe about Rose would be that she shares compassion with her sister, Anna. I figured this out because she was concerned about her younger sister as soon as she walked into the room. Rose asked her sister, 'What's wrong? You fell okay?'.
19397	7	When Rose converses with other characters in the passage such as Anna or Aunt Kolab, she shows the trait of helping her family. An example of this is when she is thinking to herself, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaraunt to work a four-hour shift...She felt too young for such responsibility'.
19398	7	Rose is compationate person. When she is talking with Anna she shows that she is willing to help put Paul through college.
19399	7	fgfsdfgs
19400	7	One trait the Rose has is that she repsect her family and her home. Rose is also grateful for what she has but everything is getting to hard for her. Aunt knew that their was something wrong with Rose and Aunt Kolab try to talk to her about the stressful times. Also Aunt Kolab help Rose feel better by saying how she would help around by making special treats.
19401	7	When Rose had her conversation with Anna, Anna says, 'Money isn't everything.'  They Rose replies, 'Only if you already have everything,' and this shows that Rose thinks that money is very important and she thinks she needs it to be happy. In the end of the story Rose finds that she can still be happy and not have everything in the world.
19402	7	THAT ROSE WAS REALLY MAD
19403	7	By reading the conversations with Rose and Aunt Kolab, that Rose is hopeful that things will get better. In paragraph 23, it says, 'Maybe he life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.'
19404	7	She is sad because she wants to Graduate like Paul. It said how happy her parents were when they watched him walk the stage.
19405	7	One of Rose's trait would be that she is very respectful of her family. For example in her conversation will Aunt Kolab, instead of Rose telling her anut how she really felt, she just kept it to her self. Rose did this because Rose knew that if she told Aunt Kolab how she really felt, it would hurt her Aunt's feelings deeply.
19406	7	Anna seems optimistic, by the way that she tries to say how everything is going to be okay to Rose. She said that money isn't everything and that even though they don't have a lot of money they will still get through the family stuggles. One detail that supports that she is optimistic, is how she talked about how money isn't everything.
19407	7	She tries to watch what she says and she doesn't want to say anything to hurt who she's talking to, like when she's talking to Aunt Kolab and she doesn't answer the first question, and she only nods when her Aunt questions her further.
19408	7	Rose is very stressed out all the time. She has work and school and she has to take care of her family.
19409	7	Rose is family oriented, when talking to her Aunt she surpressed what she was really feeling because she did not want to hurt her Aunt.
19410	7	'Only if you already had everything,'  it shows that Rose is trying to act like a grown up, based on Anna'a response: 'You sound just like Mama.'
19411	7	She's optimistic.  She tells Anna that it will all get better in the end so they just need to stick it out, and they will finally have their turn.
19412	7	The reader can tell that Rose is an idealist when she talks to Anna.  She can see the good in everyone and every situation.  She knows that as long as she keeps her head on her shoulders, she will succeed in school.  She is stressed out by the amount of work she has to do, but she loves her family and is willing to sacrifice her time to do what is best for them.  It is very apparent that she cares for her little sister.  Rose tells Anna that there is nothing to worry about, but they have to make intelligent decisions and they will get to where they want to be.
19413	7	she dosent want to upset her aint or mom. you find this out when she dosnt answer her aints question.
19414	7	She is selfless. She feels like she has a lot of pressure on her but she won't tell anyone else in the family because she knows how it might make them feel.
19415	7	Lonely for when she told Anna 'only if you have everything' when she did a fake laugh after that you could tell she feels lonely without her mom and dad being gone.
19416	7	That she feels guitly for pauls death beacuse she said she hold his life in her hands
19417	7	Rose is a good listener. When her aunt was talking to her, she kept nodding because she understood.
19418	7	'Rose feels weighed down and guilty.' Rose has been lying to her family and scared to tell he aunt the truth because, It would hurt her and her aunt would probably tell her mother.
19419	7	One trait that could be used to describe Rose in this story is torn. In the converstaion with Aunt Kolab Rose cannot decide whether to relate the dream. She doesn't know whether to tell the truth. She doesn't want anyone to be mad. She's evidently struggling with all the internal battles going on within her. In the story Rose thinks of how she's going to fit in the time to write the essay and acknowledges that even if she wins the competition she can't go to receive the prize because she is too busy. But will she be able to finish the essay in time? Will she keep her job? What are her priorities? She is torn between what to do and how to do it.
19420	7	Anna seems to be a respectful person. She didnt want to hurt her aunts feelings by telling her bluntly that she was right.
19421	7	Through Rose's conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose shows optimism. Instead of giving up and sulking in her family's issues, Rose realizes that tradition and sense of family are important in Cambodian customs, and uses this for her essay topic.
19422	7	Rose doesnt want to dissapoint her mom, aunt and brother by the pressures and harddships she is going through so she keeps all of it to herself.
19423	7	Rose is a very concerned child. She thinks that if she were to tell her aunt about the dream she had then it would hurt her aunt.
19424	7	Understanding. 'He had to go. The jon in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
19425	7	Rose is a very responsible character. This is evident in the text when Rose is trying to help Anna understand why their family is doing what they are by telling Anna that, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This statement shows that Rose has her family's best interest in mind and knows what she has to do to help.
19426	7	Rose is a stressed girl. In paragraph 23 it says that her aunts advice made her feel lighter when means she was relieved of some stress.
19427	7	Rose feels that she has to get the high standards like her brother, get good grades, work, go to a good college; but she is doing some much at one point in her life that is weighing her down and she gets to busy and can't keep up with what she needs to do.
19428	7	Rose is discouraged and pessmistic. Here's an example from the story. Rose sees her brother boulder dragging her down. Rose doesn't think she's going to win the essay contest.
19429	7	One of the trait that i think can describe rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is when Anna is talking to Rose saying to her that she had a  bad dream. Then they started talking about how their mom worked to much and when her Papa left too. The trait is that she is very unpasiant with other people who annoye her.
19430	7	She acts like she is having an okay life, like the way she acted when talking to Anna, but inside she feels like it's too demanding when she says she is insane, in paragraph 3, orwhen she talks to her Aunt
19431	7	Rose feels there is too much pressure put on her from her family, and she is too young to handle it. 'She felt too young for so much responsibility.'
19432	7	One trait that can describe Rose is working hard. She claims that they all have their part to do to help Paul finish college.
19433	7	Anna is very helpful when it comes to her family, because everything they do its for her brother Paul. You can tell by when she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' in paragraph eleven line two and three.
19434	7	One trait that describe Rose is that she has hope and she believe things will get better. When her Aunt Kolab was suggesting ways that she could help the family out, this gave Rose encouragement about tasks she needed to complete.
19435	7	She is hard working. She works goes to school and helps around the house
19436	7	Rose is confused. When her aunt asks her if she felt weighed down by whats she's doing to help the family, and she has no response for her. She wants to help her family, but she also feels as though its a burden, bacause she doesn't have enough time to get everything done. Therefore she is confused on whether or not she is weighed down by everything she does for the family.
19437	7	One trait about Rose is that she is caring, because in the story she said that if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt.  Rose didn't want to hurt her aunt so she didn't tell her how she really feels.
19438	7	She is a person who cares about her sister.  Because when she had a bad dream she helped her out by giving her a cup of orange juice and tried to make her laugh.
19439	7	Rose is prone to self-sacrifice, often ignoring her own feelings in order to make her family feel better. A good example of this is in her conversation with Aunt Kolab, when she thinks that 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Luckily, people like her aunt can see right though her, and learn what she really thinks.
19440	7	she is mean and not very catious
19441	7	Rose has the trait of persistance and tries to make positives out of difficult situations. An example of positivity While discussing with Anna about missing their father, she said it was good for them because he was making more money then where he was currently at. Also an example of how Rose has the trait of persistnace is the fact that she goes to school, then goes to work, then comes home to help cook, and still tries to maintain her homework.
19442	7	Hard-working.   She is in school, she has a job, and she has to write a 3 thousand word essay.
19443	7	One trait that can describe Rose is caring. In her conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose was afraid to answer her aunt's question about how helping the family made her feel because she didn't want her mother to be hurt when Aunt Kolab told her.
19444	7	Selfish,b she really doesn't care what her aunt thinks cause she wont talk to her back all she does is nod or not answer at all.
19445	7	She is depressed and run down by everything going on.
19446	7	Rose is understanding.  She explains to her sister that their dad has to work in Las Angeles because their family needs more money.
19447	7	she fights alot with her sister
19448	7	She is very kind. When she was talking to Anna, she was being gentle when she said 'It's only been four months.' Then when Aunt Kolab as her if she felt weighed down, Rose didn't answer ebcause she didn't want to hurt Aunt Kolab or her mother.
19449	7	Rose feels that all the weight of her family is on her, all the struggles her and her family go through weigh down on her.  One detail from the story is her aunt questions her and asks 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family?'
19450	7	One trait that identifies Rose is
19451	7	One trait that Rose shows toward Anna is that she tries to make evryone happy at the shame time. When she explained that her family was working together to have a better life.
19452	7	Lets see here one trait for rose could be how caring she is for other people in this world and how she wants to help more.'Maybe I can sew for ladies.'
19453	7	She is hopefull that things will get easier.  You can tell she has a lot to deal with because earlier she thought ' Paul's fate lies partly in these',  refering to her hands and the situation she is facing.
19454	7	Rose is very sincere with her sister and even though she doesn't listen to what Anna has to say all the time, she still tries to be a good sister. In the story, Rose tries to calm Anna down about their dad leaving.
19455	7	Shes very considerate. She offered to sew for ladies or even make special treats for the people in Cambodia to sell. which states in paragraph 22.
19456	7	I think rose is having a really hard time trying to keep every thing together and not crack  and thats what i think the dream was to say that she is under so much pressure
19457	7	Rose is a hopeful person. As the conversation ends between Anna and herself she tells Anna that if they help Paul, then he will get a good job and pay for their college education.
19458	7	One trait that describes Rose would be stressed out.  She has a dream and discusses it with her aunt.  In the dream he brother is weighing her down, this relates to how she feels in everyday life.  She has to work at the restaraunt, help with dinner go to school, she can't even go accept an award in  Sacramento.  She has no time for herself and she feels as though she is being sufficated.
19459	7	I sense that Rose is always trying to do her best, and to keep people happy. My example is paragraph 2, where she expains all the things she does for her teachers, boss, and aunt.
19460	7	Rose in this story seems to show optomism in a situation in which she feels hopeless to overcome.  For instance, her characteristic shows when she speaks to Anna.  Anna only see all that is wrong with life at the moment; whereas, Rose looks father into the future where there maybe more positive answers.
19461	7	Rose has a sense of responsibility. In paragrah 11 she talks to her younger sister, Anna, about how they have to help Paul go to college so that he can get a job and help them go to college. If Rose would have been older she would have taken on this challenge for herself to help her family, but she must take make sure that her older brother, Paul, makes it into college so that she can take care of everyone for herself. That way she doesn't have to rely on others to help and she can do it herself.
19462	7	She is very negative and it is hard for her to sometimes see the the positive side of some things. She said in paragraph 3 'Even if I win, I won't get to travel to Sacromento to receive the prize'.
19463	7	-Rose acts like a mother figure to Anna, as exemplified by the lines 'Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table. 'You sound just like Mama.'
19464	7	Rose thinks that the family is doing a good thing and Anne she justs wants to be with her dad.  I don't think that Rose realizes that Anne is younger and she doesn't understand that her family is trying to do the right thing for the family.
19465	7	Family oriented. She decided to write her essay about Cambodian tradition, which is her family tradition. Her aunt helped her decide to do that.
19466	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is a strong young lady.  When her aunt asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' she did not say anything because she knew it would hurt her aunt and her mom.  She kept it to herself, which is a strong thing to do; keeping things bottled up inside and being able to handle a lot of emotional stress.
19467	7	Rose can look at a situation through other people's perspectives, as Aunt Kolab points out, 'But now I  realize that you're seeing the situation throught other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here....'
19468	7	Rose is caring, when her aunt asked if she felt weighed down, Rose didnt answer. She felt that if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt, and probably her aunt would tell her mother.
19469	7	I would say hard working, because in the text Anna states that, money isn't everything. That tells me that she works a lot and is hard working.
19470	7	One trait that Rose has is determination. Its supported by the converstion with Ana. Rose says, ' I fell alseep working on my essay,' this shows that she wanted to get it done. Even though she was tired, she didn't give up and go to bed.
19471	7	Rose is caring. She works a four-hour shift after school just so that she can help her brother. Then she rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab make dinner for the family.
19472	7	She dosent like to give up. She dosent have time to write an eassy and if she did she could not clam her prise. She still works for it tho.
19473	7	Rose is very concerned with the well being of her family because when she was asked if she was being overwhelmed by work, she said no to keep her aunt happy.
19474	7	secluded. She wishes she could tell her aunt about the dream so that it would loosen its grip on her.
19475	7	While talking to her Aunt Kolab, you can tell Rose is a considerate person because she thinks to herself that she does not want to make her aunt feel bad by telling her she needs help.
19476	7	Rose is a girl that tries to look on the bright side and does what she has to do 'We have or part to do to help Parul finish college. Then he'll get good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19477	7	I think Rose can be described as realistic because in line 9 she say 'It's only been 4 months,' 'The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' When she was discussing about why their dad left.
19478	7	She is concerned about everyone else.
19479	7	Rose is strong. In the story, it says ' Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'  This shows that although Rose is overwhelmed, she is stong and doesn't want to hurt others.
19480	7	Rose doesn't want to hurt anyone, so sometimes doesn't tell how she truely feel to help the feelings of others. In both converstaions with Anna and with Aunt Kolab, Rose isn't honest because she doesn't want to hurt anyones feelings. With Anna, she tries to make her sister feel better about their dad being away and their mom working so late hours. When talking to her Aunt Rose holds back telling how responsible she feels about everything.
19481	7	The trait that describes Rose best based on her conversations with Anna or her Aunt is that she is very worried about money. Rose says 'The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
19482	7	Rose feels pressured becasuse all of the responsibilities. She felt to young for so much resonsibility.
19483	7	rose is hard working , she works a four hour shift then comes home and helps her aunt cook diner and she still finds time to do her home work and is desided to write the 3hree- thousand-word essay.
19484	7	She tries to be happy most of the time.  Even though she doesn't want to she laughs in her conversation with Anna.
19485	7	Ann and Rose conversation was good  but when they start talking about there father and they're mother......it was not good for Anna she got up and storm away.
19486	7	Rose is just looking for a way to have a lessened burden on her shoulders. She said she wishes her life would get easier, and she told Anna that after Paul finishes college that he will get a good job and send them to college as well.
19487	7	A person who can be there for others. Trying to console Anna because Anna is worried about their dad being away for so long.
19488	7	Rose is a hard worker.  In the story it tells how she goes from school straight to work and then straight home to cook and do her homework.
19489	7	Rose is motherly and strong willed. In the story she shows her motherly features by how the sister comes to her when she is scared and how Rose takes care of her sister by giving her juice and such things to make her feel better about the nightmare.
19490	7	One trait she expresses is ambition. She talks to her about how life is difficult and not rewarding. She promotes a idea that makes her aunt curious by sewing for ladies or making special treats and sell them.
19491	7	Rose is a considerate human being because she helps Anna through her problem of missing papa by trying to reassure her that hes making more money in Los Angeles and that Paul will get a job soon after he graduates college to help with the money problems.
19492	7	One trait that describes Rose is how caring she is. Even when she is struggling with her own internal struggles to stay determined, she still takes time out to talk to her sister about her problems.When she is talking to her aunt, she stresses the fact that she does not want to be a burden, and that she knows she needs to help the family. The reader gets a sense of how caring she is from these two situations.
19493	7	Rose's conversation with Anna shows that she is caring and will try to help people feel better. It shows because of how she kept saying all the good things that will happen after Anna says how she misses her father.
19494	7	Rose is aware of others feelings.  She asks her sister about how she is feeling earlier in the story.
19495	7	Rose can be described as hopeful because she believes that everything will be okay when Paul gets through college and gets a job to pay for his sister's schooling in college.
19496	7	Rose is exhausted from doing to many things in such little time and she doesnt really have time to do anything for herself. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?'
19497	7	One trait of Anna's is that she is very hardworking.  In the story, she tries to take all of her family's weight by helping them out and it's actually weighing herself down.
19498	7	From the conversations that Rose takes part in you can tell that she feels responsible for her actions that she needs to finish.
19499	7	The trait that you can easily describ Rose with would be; how see seems to concel her own emotions from a conversation she doesn't really want to relate to. So she seems to be more optimistic, by saying something positive.
19500	7	One trait that could describe Rose would be thoughtful. Because in the story, the author states that Rose gets up and leaves the kitchen when she is talking to her sister Anna. She got up from the table because nobody else would think about what Paul should be doing with his life instead of thinking and worrying and providing for his mother and sisters. many words could be used to describe her but this is a main one.
19501	7	In Rose and Anna's conversation, I can sense that Rose likes to face reality, and does not try to put things off. By telling her sister that Paul will get a job and support them, she seems hopeful that this will actually happen.
19502	7	Rose hides a lot of feelings from others so that they may be encouraged, or at least not worried.  This makes her seems like a very selfless person who thinks she is being taken advantage of.
19503	7	Based on the conversations in the story, Rose seems to be optimistic. when her sister Anna said, 'Money isn;t everything.' and Anna replies, 'Only if you already have everything.' that goes to show she onlt has so much belief in her situation.
19504	7	bad attitude. Rose kept nodding

19507	7	That she is a hard working, and that she is always busy. Rose had to write a three-thousand-word essay.
19508	7	She is honorable due to her not telling her aunt the truth, because it would hurt her if she heard it.
19509	7	Rose conversation with her Aunt Kolab was something she needing because it give her an idea for her essay.  Her aunt was trying to make figure things out to make her life better. Such as a money thing her aunt said maybe they can sew for the ladies or make special treats from their country and sell them.
19510	7	Rose feels depressed and lonely about her life so she wants to end it fro good.And she also has bad dream all the time.
19511	7	she is stressed out by every thing going on with her family.'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family'
19512	7	they can figure out how to do things differently.  a way better for themselves
19513	7	Rose is understanding. She demonstrates this when talking to Aunt Kolab, instead of pittying herself, she now accepts the misfortune and decides that there are other things that can be done.
19514	7	The conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab shows that rose has the desire to please everyone. When Aunt Kolab asks 'Do you feel so wieghed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose doesnt answer. This shows that she not only doesn't want to upset her Aunt or her mother, but she also just wants to do what she can to please everyone.
19515	7	Rose is helpful because she and her sister are doin everything they can to help there brother Paul get through college.
19516	7	Rose thinks that she is the only who can probably help her family.
19517	7	When she's trying to explain to Anna about why their parents always have to work it shows how she's very caring and she's always there for her family. Also she cares about what other people think when she's talking to her aunt.
19518	7	Rose is sincere and really cares for others. You can tell because she didnt want to tell her aunt how she felt because she thought it would upset her.
19519	7	Rose is an immigrant. In the twentyth paragraph, during the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab, it is brought to the readers attention that the family was from Cambodia. Aunt Kolab said, '...our first country.'
19520	7	SHE HAS RESPECT FOR HER AUNT. AT THE END OF THE STORY ROSE DIDNT GIVE HER ANSWER TO HER AUNT'S QUESTION CAUSE SHE KNEW SHE WOULD HURT HER AUNT.
19521	7	Rose is very lonely.
19522	7	Rose is a very dedicated, especially to her family. Besides her working almost every day directly after school, then coming home to help around the house, and then focusing on her school work was very demanding for her. Also, she has to stay positive and be a role model for her younger sister. Anna does not seem to completely understand the entire situation like Rose does. Rose explains to her that all they are doing is to for their brother, Paul, to go to school, so he can get a job to pay for them to go to school. The conversation they have shows the reader that Rose always keeps the goal in mind and will do whatever it takes to achieve it.
19523	7	Rose is very thoughtful. She is thinking about all sides of the situation. Whatever conflict it may be, shes thinking of everyone. Her brother, ssister, parents, it does not matter. She is very deep in though through most of the story. Dreaming and thinking always.

19525	7	Rose would do anything for her sister Anna.'Anna,'Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
19526	7	She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.
19527	7	From the converstaion that Rose had with Anna the reader can identify the trait that Rose wants to be grown up. She pretends to give the answer that their mother would give about their father working. Rose just wants to say the right thing and comfort Anna.
19528	7	Rose loves to be around her family, she is family oriented. She misses her dad, and thinks he should be working more closer to home. She thinks that money isn't everything, but Anna knows that the family needs money for them to go to college.
19529	7	In my personal opinon the one trait that best describes Rose is strong. I belive this would be the best trait to classify Rose because she is carrying alot on her shoulders and even though her sister Anna is breaking down she still manages to stand strong and trys to comfort her sister even though she is holding alot. This is showed in paragraphs 9-12 when the two sisters are having therre conversation.
19530	7	Rose's trait whould probably be protection and loyalty... She cares alot ablut her family and are verry awhere of what she needs to do. But she is also confused...
19531	7	Rose is considerate of others' feelings. In her conversation with Anna, Rose expresses her concern by asking 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'. Even though Rose was exhausted from school, her job and the daunting task of an essay, she had concern for Anna.
19532	7	One trait that describes Rose is caring. Rose is caring because she tries to be there for her family all the time leaving how she really feels out of the families problems. One way that you can tell that Rose is caring is when her aunt asks her how she feels and she doesnt answer. Rose didnt answer in fear that she may have hurt her aunts feelings. so in the situation Rose is caring to her familly.
19533	7	One trait Rose seems to have based on the story is that she is very responsible. While talking to Anna, she never mentions the stress she feels. Her main concern is trying to comfort her sister. It is said that she is in charge for taking care of her sister while her mother works late at night. It also states that she has a job, and balances schoolwork on top of everything else.
19534	7	One traight that describes Rose is caring. She shows how important her family is to her by explaining her day.  She says that she attends school and work, helps with the meal at home, and finishes her homework because this is what her family needs from her.  Rose accomplishes all of these tasks because she deeply cares about her family.
19535	7	Rose is a girl that cares about everyone. When Anna walked in the kitchen Rose served her some orange juice and talked with her. Rose was trying to comfort Anna for their parents not being around much often.
19536	7	Rose is a stressful child. You can tell by the question Aunt Kolab ask, she ask if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help this family. As if she put stress on her self in order to help her family.
19537	7	She cares alot about her family and is concerned about everyone. She is a very caring person and worries about others. It seems like she feels she needs to put the weight on her own shoulders. I conclude this from paragraph 18, when Rose's aunt says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. Rose didn't answer. Also in paragraph 11 Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for me and you to go to college.'
19538	7	Rose is under a boat load of pressure.  She is feeling wieghed down with the job she is working four hour shifts at and how he also has to help around the house making dinner and paying for her brothers college tuition.  You can tell that she is tired and is taking it out on her family memebers.  She is also having bad dreams about the amount of pressure she is under.
19539	7	She seems depressed. Her father is not around for her, her mother works late on into the night, also doesn't have much time for herself. She has to: go to school, go to work, help make supper, then she can work on her homework. that doesn't soon like a nice day to me.
19540	7	In the story Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This statement makes me believe that Rose is responsible. She realizes her family has to make sacrafices so they will be happy later on down the road.
19541	7	Responsible, becuase when Rose said to Anna that they have to do their part in helping Paul so he can graduate from college. Rose would be kind of like her mother, because her mother would work overtime and she would sometimes not be home as much as she would like to be but she knows its something that she has to do.
19542	7	Rose is a nice person because it says, 'Rose said as gently as she could.' Rose was being as nice as she could to her little sister.
19543	7	If Rose had one trait, it would be caring. She expresses this trait when she says that she wants her and her families lives to get better.
19544	7	One trait to describe rose would be Hard-working. I would describe her as this because of the fact that every day she goes to school , works to help her family with money, helps cook , and is trying to better herself by writting an essay showing she is willing to work in life.
19545	7	Rose felt an urgent need  to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
19546	7	Rose is very caring. When Anna awoke and spoke to Rose in the kitchen, she tried to comfort Anna.
19547	7	Rose is not an open person. She tends to hide what she is really feeling by making a different comment or attempting to change the topic. In the story, Rose tells her sister that money isn't everything unless you already have everything because her sister believes that money isn't everything. This refers to why Rose is not an open person.
19548	7	Rose is a very worried or depressed girl. she is afraid that she won't be able to attend college because of a short of money in their family.
19549	7	She is an exremely hard worker. In the story she up late at night writing an essay for a competion for a chance to go to Sacramento. During so she sonferts her baby sister after a bad dream frighten her.
19550	7	Rose is very selfless.  She is working very hard at her job and with the family to make sure her brother gets through school.
19551	7	She is considerate of other peoples feelings because she doesnt want to tell her aunt that she feels weighted down because she would feel bad.
19552	7	I think Rose is hopeful, when she was talking with her sister Ana was tring to make everything look dim and hopeless but Rose tried telling her that it was going to be ok and everything was going to work out.
19553	7	She is very caring, she doesn't want to tell her the truth because she mite hurt her Aunt's feelings.
19554	7	She tries everything she can to keep her family happy even if it is to much for her. I think this because she lets her sister know it's going to be alright and she doesn't tell her aunt how she really feels.
19555	7	Rose is a very kind person, she is the type that will work hard to help out her family in need. Even though she was tired Rose did not want to tell her Aunt Kolab because it may have hurt her feelings.
19556	7	That your family will be there for you and to help you through what ever happens in your life. Just like how in the story when Rose's life gets really overwhelming she just had to tell someone and then her Aunt Kolab told her that she could help her with the sewing.
19557	7	One trait in which Rose expresses is that she is supporting in what her family members do.  One can see this when Rose is talking about Paul in college.  She tried to make his finishing college seem like a good thing that will pay off in the end.
19558	7	Rose is a very caring person. She shows this trait by asking Anna what is wrong and if she feels okay.
19559	7	One trait from Rose based on her Coversations with Anna or Aunt Kolob is that Rose seems very nice and often keeps to her self, it also seems like she often gets confused and puzzled about things. She also seems like she doesnt always say what she wants to, because it the story it says 'Good morning, Rose' her aunt said. Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her. After she'd finish her aunt said, with a puzzled look, ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
19560	7	Rose is an honest character who tells people what is on her mind and what she is up too. She confides in her family and has nothing to hide unless she thinks it will hurt her loved ones. We see this when she tells her aunt about the dream but holds back on her feelings of being weighted down by her obligations so she wouldn't hurt her aunt.
19561	7	Rose is passive, and keeps to herself. When her Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help the family she lied and said 'no', eventhough that is not how she truely felt.
19562	7	Rose is a type of person who wants to graduate. Her older brother has already accomplished graduating and she remembers how proud her parents were of him. Now Rose wants to graduate as well and have her parents be proud of her just like they were for her brother.
19563	7	Rose appears to be an extremely strong individual, and has many qualities of a very successful and amiable leader.  She has the strength and courage to continue with her daily life, even when she's battling an immense internal struggle.  Although Rose felt she was too young for so much responsibility, she can learn to overcome familial and societal odds.  During Rose and Anna's converstation, Rose boosts Anna's morale, like a good leader should.
19564	7	suppressed, she doesn't tell how she really feels about Paul.
19565	7	Rose exhibits determination. Although she is not happy about it, she still realizes that they have to help Paul. She even tells Anna, 'We have to do our part to help Paul...'
19566	7	Rose is a girl that has a lot on her plate and she does not know how to handle all of it. Therefore, she can't.      When she talked to Anna, she vented how she was feeling about the situation within her family. Though she was trying to be hopeful and not bring down Anna any longer, she knows how to make situations worse for herself.
19567	7	Rose is quiet.  She does not answer her aunt through the whole conversation.  She justs nodded her head.
19568	7	Rose is weighed down by a lot of things in her life. She wants to tell her aunt but she doesn't want to hurt her feelings so she doesn't say anything. She also decides not to tell her aunt about the dream she had on the previous night. This shows that Rose has compassion for others, even when she has a lot on her plate.
19569	7	She is a very caring person, and she always wants to help. She always try's to be very nice.She asked her sister if she was okay.
19570	7	CaringRose doesn't want to hurt her aunt because she cares to much about her.
19571	7	One trait that describes Rose is loyal. I know this because when her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by family; she didn't answer becuse she knew it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
19572	7	She was taughtful. She recognized that when her aunt asked her if she feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family that if she answers, she might hurt her mom's and her aunt's feelings.
19573	7	Emotional. Because she feels that she has Paul's fate in her hands, which also is their families fate. When she cupped her hands and said 'Paul's fate lies partly in these.'
19574	7	Rose is sincere because when her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by everything that she is doing, she considered her aunt's feelings and did not answer.
19575	7	Rose is troubled, as she worries about how her family is going to make a living when she talks to Anna about her father having to move away to help the family make more money.
19576	7	Rose is on of the people in this story that don't care about any thing that she does. She's got a bad view on everything that she does. Its almost like she don't even care about any thing or any one in her family but, the money that he papa gets from work.
19577	7	Rose is a responsible and respectful young girl. She tells her aunt that she was feeling weighed down by all the work she had been doing to help the family. She also does not want to hurt her mother or aunt by saying she does not want to help out because she has to much going on at one time.
19578	7	Rose can be described as self-centered.  Rose may be doing a lot of work but so is everyone else.  In the story it says that Rose's dad isn't living with the family because he is working in another city.  From the story we can see that Rose is only caring about herself and no one else.
19579	7	Rose tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. She really is feeling upset what is going on, that she trys to laugh about it, but she just can.
19580	7	Rose is trying to be a 'glass half full' kind of person. She thinks to herself 'Maybe life would get easier.' She is trying to stay positive.
19581	7	After reading the passage, a trait that best describes Rose is motherly touch that she has on her life. An example from the text is when Rose is talking to Anna she has to act like the mother because their mother is out working late just lik every night.
19582	7	Rose is Agervated very easily because of the essay she cant finnish
19583	7	Rose feels overwhelmed by all the stress her family is putting her through. She feels this way because her family is kind of differnt from others. her and her sister have to make sure their brother graduates from collage and she has to do a three thousand word essay amd at the same time she has a job to go to a family to take care of and school work to do and her father is away in Los Angelos with a job that is making more money than his last job. I guess all this is too much for her to deal with at one time. But her aunt kolab tells her in a conversation that they have in the kitchen that in their first country cambodia this all would be normal. But shes seeing things through others eyes and its making her forget where she came from so it is making things difficult for her to process all at one time.
19584	7	Rose is very helpful and understanding.  You can tell she has these traits when she is talking to Anna about Mama and Papa.
19585	7	Rose is stressed, her parents are not home that often because they are helping pay for her brothers collage. So rose has to help take care of the family, write and essay and a million other things that are crashing down on top of her.
19586	7	I believe Rose can be described as comforting. When she is discussing with Anna the absence of their father she tried to reassure Anna and make his situation out to be not as bad as it seemed to her.
19587	7	One trait that describes Rose is hardworking because she is trying to help her brother Paul finish college and do the things that she needs to get done.
19588	7	Rose is a very responsible girl for her age. An example of this is how hard she is trying to write an essay worthy to win the state competition.
19589	7	Rose worries about money. She has a job so that she can help her family out, and her dad moved away to a job that pays more so that they can afford to send his son to college.
19590	7	I would describe Rose as a very responsible person, because in the story she is in school which is a very consuming task, she alson has a job that she works after school, she has to help make dinner so her family can eat, she is a very responsible person for her age.
19591	7	Rosa is overwhelmed with the responsibility of helping take care of her family. This is seen when Rosa tells her Aunt Kolab about her dream and her aunt asks her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rosa doesn't answer, fearing that she would hurt her Aunt Kolab if she told her the truth. (paragraph 18-19)
19592	7	Thoughtful. Rose shows that she is thoughtful be recognizing how Paul's responsiblity is much worse having to watch out for both of his sisters at just three years older than Rose.
19593	7	rose is having problem writing her essay.
19594	7	One Trait that Rose seems to have throughout this story is selflessness as she keeps her pain from her sister and tries to keep her sisters mind off of negative thoughts to make her happy. Then how she pushes the weight of everything on her self and doesn't truly ask for any help from Aunt Kolab just an open ear to tell the pain of her dream.
19595	7	One trait that can describe Rose would be that she is very carring for her Aunt Kolab. In the text it states that if she told her Aunt Kolab that truth about how she feels that it might hurt her and that her Aunt and she would probably tell her mom.
19596	7	One trait Rose has is hard working. She does alot for her family and wants to be satisfied. In the story Roses conversation between her and her sister shows that she is hard working. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' Rose says.
19597	7	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that when she says money isn't everything it really shows that she cares about her parent's money, she respects them, and really does like helping them out.
19598	7	SELF-CENTERED
19599	7	She deals with her conflict by herself and don't express them unless she needs to. When she is talking to Anna she defends her parents because she knows that they are working for them to go to collage. She don't express what she doesn't need to.
19600	7	When Rose is talking to Anna it shows that she is strong and doesn't want to give up on her family. She said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' She is also loving to Anna here by trying to let her know that everything will be alright.
19601	7	I believe that Rose is always optimistic. She kept her feelings to herself when she was talking with Anna and she just tried to make her feel better. With Aunt Kolab, Rose feels like she has a chance for a better life. Aunt Kolab gives her hope, and that is all that Rose needs.
19602	7	Rose was very stressed. She had homework to do,school,work,and chores at home.
19603	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she feels burdened. She says to her Aunt Kolab, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
19604	7	Rose is Sympathetic, she saw the situation in her aunts eyes, not just in her own view. She was worried that she would hurt her aunt if she told her that she felt so weighed down by what she she, herself was doing to help the family.
19605	7	Rose is hard working. This is evident by the things she does every day to not only better her life, but also the people in her family. She juggles going to school, working at a resturaunt, and doing homework all so her brother can finish going to college.
19606	7	Rose seems like a really nice girl, she just doesn't realize that money, infact, DOESN'T mean everything. ' Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything.' ' Then Rose goes into an explanation on why they need money for college and stuff.
19607	7	Rose was feeling discouraged.  She felt too young for so much responsibility.
19608	7	Rose is very optimistic with every situation she is dealt, even if it is hard to deal with.
19609	7	Rose is faithful. Not only is she fathful to her brother, but also to her family and herself. Shes working to help pay for her brother to be in college and she helps around the house since her mother has to work late shifts. Shes also faithful to her father because she stands up for him when her sister was saying that she hated how he left them.
19610	7	Roes does not want to hurt her family and let them down that is why she did not want to tell her aunt how she felt because she did not wnat to hurt her aunt or her mother.
19611	7	I think Rose is humble because of the way she responded to Aunt Kolab's question. She didnt really want to say she felt weighed down, so instead she just nodded. this shows that she feels that way but she loves her family so she doesnt say it.
19612	7	One word to describe Rose is worried.  Rose has to write a three thousand word essay, go to work, and help her aunt care for Anna and the house.  She lives a very hectic life, and it has put a great deal of strain on her.  One example of this is when Rose and Anna are in the kitchen, and Anna says 'Money isn't everything,' while Rose replys: 'Only if you have everything.' This shows that she is also worried about money in their family.
19613	7	I would describe Rose by saying that she may not be the most grateful worker, but she is determined to help her family. In paragraph 11, Rose says that we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Rose then hopes he would come back and help out herself with college. I believe Rose understands that it is hard work now but it will be worth it later when Paul is done with college.
19614	7	Rose is very caring and protective of her sister. 'Only if you alredy have everything,' Rose said. She is acting like a mother to Anna.
19615	7	She feels pressured by everything and for what she is trying to do to help the family.
19616	7	Based on the story, one trait that describes Rose would be 'stressed.' Rose is stressed because of the three-thousand-word essay she hasn't written yet.
19617	7	One trait that can be described by Rose would have to be her hard workerness. How she hardly has enough time to work her job, take after her younger sister, help make dinner, and do her homework. this is a huge work load for a teenager. Aunt Kolab can understand that. That makes Rose very happy.
19618	7	She seems like she dont like the things she has to do but she does them just to make everybody else happy, and to help them out.
19619	7	One trait that can decribe Rose would be that, she is hard working. I would say this because all of the things she does in a day. Some of those things would be going to school, working a four hour shift at a restaurant, helping her aunt make dinner, and doing her homework.
19620	7	Responsible, she shows a great deal of concern for her brother and realizes what she does can affect her brother greatly. She understands what is truely at stake and she wants to make sure she will not screw it up for her brother. So she works so hard just to help her family which shows a great deal of responsibility.
19621	7	hardworking-'from school she'd gone staight to the resturant .... then striaght home to help.... prepare a quick supper.
19622	7	Rose is a very dedicated person. In that she is dedicated to school, her job, and her family. She works really hard for herself and then gives back to her family and the job she works at after her school work. That shows alot of dedication in a teenager.     I came up with this trait in the paragraph 2, because it talked about what her days consisted of and what she did every single day. Just going to school, keeping a job and helping out her family that she could do anything for them at anytme.
19623	7	One trait that discribes Rose is caring. it seems like she tries to keep her composor while trying to do something she doesnt wants to do but the only reason why she is beacuse she loves her family and is trying to help out in what ever way she can.
19624	7	Rose is reassuring  in the conversation to her sister. She tells her that they must do their part to help Paul finish college and then he'll get a good job and pay for them to go to college.
19625	7	Rose is caring for other people. She attempts to assist her brother in his time of need, although it is difficult for her. Rose understands the responsibility she has been bestowed, but she has complications dealing with the acquired resposibility. She wants to assist her brother through college, however, she finds that it is a large burden for her, causing her to have complications in other areas as well. She feels overcome by the responsibility, yet tries to overcome it. Rose realizes that her brother has and will assist her, therefore, she needs to assist him while he needs assistance. She stands up for her brother and his requirements for help when Anna is upset about their father being away longer in order to help pay for Paul's college expenses. Her Aunt realizes the struggle Rose is having, and offers to take some responsibility from her by sewing for ladies so that it is more evenly distributed. Rose accepts this proposal seeing as it will assist her without hurting her brother.
19626	7	One way that I can describe Rose is by her sense of hard work,and love for her sister.
19627	7	Rose is a very caring person. She sacrafices a great deal of her time to support her family. She cares so much for her family that she was even unwilling to mention her dislike of all the responsibility on her shoulders to her aunt.
19628	7	a trait that she shows is caring because she does not want others to worry about her. such as an example in her conversation with anna, Anna said 'do you feel ok?' And then Rose said 'Im fine'
19629	7	In her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as understanding. One detail from the story that supports this answer is she talks about how if they help their brother get through college, he will help them later.
19630	7	penis
19631	7	One trait that describes Rose is the fact that she is very caring. When Aunt Kolab asked Anna if she felt weighted down by what she is doing for her family andn Anna said no because she didn't want to hurt her aunt.
19632	7	Rose is a very hard-working individual. She works a difficult job, tries hard in school, and helps out her family. She does so many things she barely can find the time to sleep.
19633	7	Rose is understanding. Rose listened to everything that her Aunt said and took it all in.
19634	7	Rose is very confident that her brother will pay for both her and Anna to go to college. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19635	7	Rose is very worried about her future. She explains to her sister Anna that they have to work hard or Paul will not be able to finish college.
19636	7	The trait that fits Rose the best is caring. Rose is very caring towards her Aunt Kolab and her Aunt Kolabs feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'(19).
19637	7	Rose is perceptive because she was able to foresee that her Aunt Kolab would disapprove of her emotions towards the burden Paul has put on her.
19638	7	releved
19639	7	Rose is very considerate. She trys to keep a positive attitude about life while talking to others, even though she herself does not always feel that way. While Rose is talking to her sister, in paragraphs 4-12, she explains that their father had to leave for a better paying check and that he was there to help them. She continues to say, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'     Rose explains the positive side of things to her sister, so that Anna will not worry like she does. She wants Anna to live a less stressful life than her.
19640	7	Rose cared about her sister Anna. I know this because she asked what was wrong anna and asked if she was feeling okay.
19641	7	one trait that rose has related to the conversation with anna is overwelmed by lots of things in her life.
19642	7	One trait Rose has is that she questions things a lot.
19643	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she tries to give others hope. An example of this took place when she tried to reasure her sister by telling her 'We have our part todo to help Paul finish college. Then he'll het a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19644	7	Anna says to Rose that she is just like her Mama, and Rose thinks money is everything unless you already have everything.
19645	7	One trait that would describe Rose would be how she cares about her family and understands what is going on. When she was having her conversation with Anna is was explaining how the family has to be apart to help thier older brother get through college and get them through also. With this going on they all have to work late and far away from  home.
19646	7	Rose is a very hard worker, but has way to much on her plate. She agrees with her Aunt Kolab that the way she is living right now does not suit where they live anymore. She needs to make time for herself.
19647	7	Rose is able to understand why things are happening and what is happening. Rose explains to Anna the reason that their father had gone to Sacremento and why it was a good thing.
19648	7	Rose doesn't like to tell what her problems are right away, she likes to wait until someone asks her whats wrong. Like in the passage her aunt had asked her what was wrong but at first she didn't say anything until her aunt had said that she new the reason Rose felt the way she did about how much shes helping her brother.
19649	7	From the story, one could tell that Rose is a strong person who does a lot to help her family. Even Aunt Kolab can see how difficult Rose's life may be when she says, in paragraph 20, '....This must be difficult for you.Yes?' It seems like Aunt Kolab knows that Rose is a strong person who tries her hardest.
19650	7	Rose is optomistic although she feels weighted down, she belives that things will work out for the better.That is why she tells Anna that once Paul finishes college then he will pay for the Anna and Rose to go to college and everything will work out for the better. All they need to do is be strong right now and help Paul get through college.
19651	7	Rose is very thoughtful. In both situations, she tries to stay positive and not hurt the other person's feelings. When her sister Anna comes is she asks her 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' This is a sign of thoughtfulness, she could have just said something like 'Why are you awake? You should be sleeping right now, go back to bed!' Also, the best example of this is when her aunt asks the question about her feeling weighed down by the family. The passage says that she didn't answer because if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt. Both of these examples just show how truly thoughtful Rose is.
19652	7	The trait that Rose has is selflessness. She doesn't like the way her life is going, but she knows that its necessary. She knows that life is full of stuggles and at times it may be hard, but she just has to encourage others and remember what she is working for.     She told Anna that even though times may be hard, in the end, they are working toward their future, not just Paul's, and that everything they can must be done for the good of the whole family.
19653	7	Rose likes helping out to get her brother graduated, but thinks she has way to much on her plate. Paragraph three explains all that she does in just one day. Rose does not even know when she will have time to do her three-thousand-word essay, and get everything else done that she does on a daily basis.
19654	7	One trait i noticed from this passage that can be used to describe Rose is hopeful. Rose demonstrates that she is hopeful of her brother's actions when she is conversating with her little sister Anna. This story tells us that Rose is no longer sad about her father's new job in Los Angeles. Rose says that he is making three times more than he was before, and the money will be used to help Paul; their brother, finish college. She then goes on to say that in return Paul will get a good job and pay for herself and Anna to go to college. This demonstrates how Rose is hopeful of her brother.
19655	7	Rose is shy about her feelings and doesnt try to share them with her family. 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'
19656	7	Rose hides her true feeling from her sister, Anna.  This shows how introverted she is.  Later in the story, her dream shows that she is troubled by her brother's success and worried about matching up to it, and the only reason she tells the story to her Aunt is to get the thought off of her chest.When her Aunt pushes for answers on what the dream meant to Rose, she remains quiet in fear of disturbing her family.  Rose is an introvert, and likes to keep her thoughts to herself when possible.
19657	7	You can tell how Ana is feeling by the looks on her face, such as when her Aunt woke her up she gave her a puzzled look.
19658	7	Rose seems to be somewhat optimistic, according to her conversation with Aunt Kolab. Once Aunt Kolab offers to sew for ladies, or make special treats, Rose thinks her life really could become easier.
19659	7	Rose is the type of person who cares for her family and their well being. In paragraph eleven when Rose says 'We have our own part to do to help Paul finish college,' she is showing how much she cares about her families future. Rose is conserned about not only her future in college but in her sister's, Anna, future in college also. Rose is also conserned about her mother and how late she works. Aslo her Paul's lonliness, since he is gone for four months. Also her Aunt Kolab's feelings. When they had their talk she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
19660	7	She doesn't like to do essays. When she tells her sister she fell asleep while trying to write her essay.
19661	7	I think a trait that she has is caring, she's working and busy doing stuff in school that would help her get prizes and make things better for herself just so it will help her family out and make her mom proud of her.
19662	7	The one trait that describes Rose is she is a familyperson and she hates that her parents always have to work over time or they alwaysw late. one example is '' I hate how late she has to work. example to is 'Money isn't everything'
19663	7	Rose can be comfortign.  During the conversation between Anna and Rose, Rose tries to comfort her sister Anna, because Anna is losing hope.  Rose tries to make Anna feel better about her parents, and their brother Paul saying they had to do what they had to do.
19664	7	Rose seems like a girl that has a lot of responsibilities due to her father away on business and her mother working full time. She seems exhausted when she has her conversation with Ann. Rose just wants so have all of the pressure of being the home provider put to the side, and just be the kid for once. I believe she showed Aunt Kolab how she really felt when they had a deep conversation about it.
19665	7	Rose is young but she has to act much older then her age given their situation.
19666	7	She's trying to be the optimistic one of the family. She wants to keep the sense of family together and keep it from falling apart. The way she tells Anna the bright side of the situation, that Papa has only been gone four months and that his job pays better there. That we're helping Paul get through college and that then we'll have our chance to get an education. She wants to let Anna know it will all be alright.
19667	7	Rose cares alot about Anna and was just trying to help solve the problem of why she was upset. When Rose said 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' is what explains my answer.
19668	7	Rose is caring because her aunt could tell something was wrong but yet Rose didnt want to say because she was more worrried about hurting her aunts feelings, than telling the truth about what was bothering her.
19669	7	She keeps things to herself.'if i tell her i would hurt my aunt, then she would tell my mother'
19670	7	THAT THEY DO NOT GIT A LONG AT ALL
19671	7	Rose is compassionate. She said that she did not want to hurt her Aunt's feelings if she told her the truth about what she is doing to try and help her family. She knew that her Aunt Kolab would be hurt if she told her that she did feel weighed down.
19672	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is very hardworking, but she is currently being pushed too hard.  In the story, Rose says she is insane because she has to somehow fit a perfect three-thousand-word essay in her life.  She will most likely complete the essay, but she is being pushed too hard.  She has to be  hard-working in order ot complete four hours of work, homework, and helping Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper in one day.  She is hardworking, but she is being pushed to hard to complete all these tasks.
19673	7	Rose feels exhausted. In the first paragraph she explains how hectic her day was and she has to always take care of her sister.
19674	7	Rose stressed about how busy her life is. For example, Rose just nodds her head when her aunt asks if she has really been bothered by as much as what she is doing for her family.
19675	7	Rose is very mature for her age. In the story she tells Anna why everything is going on about why her parents are trying their best to earn money. She is very calm in her approach with Anna.
19676	7	Anna told Rose that she sounds just like momma.
19677	7	Rose is exhausted from all the hard work she does.She helps out her family. Aunt Kolab asks Rosa 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rosa doesn't answer because she is affraid of hurting her aunt or mom. Her aunt does sense that Rosa is feeling weighed down so her aunt offers to help by making special treats for their country or sew for ladies.
19678	7	Rose is very down about everything. she doesn't really see the hope in anything, i think. she is talking with her aunt and telling her how much her life sucks because she's not in the old country. I'm sure she misses it. It's kind of obvious.
19679	7	One trait that describes Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is hopeful.  Rose is going through a hard time being so busy and trying to help the family as much as she can.  Anna came to her complaining about the same thing Rose was inside, but Rose put on a happy face and tried to help Anna see the positive side of it.  She was trying to be hopeful for her sister and for herself.     When Rose was talking to her Aunt, she told Rose that she wasnted to help relieve some of the stress off of her shoulders. This gave her a great sense of hope that maybe things would get better for their family.
19680	7	Overwhelmed is the best character trait to describe Rose, because she puts a lot of pressure on herself to acheive her and her families goals. She goes to work for four hours each day after to school to help put her brother through college, which leaves her very little free time to do what she wants.
19681	7	Rose seems like a caring individual, she wants to help her brother get through school. Thats why see goes to work everyday, and goes to school, she works hard for others. Although she does expect a little in return, she would like someone to take some of the burden off her hands, as well as her brother paying for her and her little sister, Anna.
19682	7	Rose is an intelligent young girl after her talk with her Aunt Kolab she realize from the coversation what her topic should be.
19683	7	ANNA CAN BE A  BIT CARELESS WHEN IT SAID I FELL ASLEEP DURING MY ESSAY
19684	7	She feels so weighted down by what she doing to help her family.She was scared because it would hurt her aunts feelings.
19685	7	Rose is determined.'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family?'
19686	7	Rose is strong. When she talks to Anna she tries to not let her sister see she is worried. In the passage 'Crossing Over' Anna says that 'Money isn't everything.' Rose replies to this by saying 'only if you already have everything.' After saying this she tries to laugh even though it is fake. She does all this because she loves her sister and doesn't want her to know how scared she is.
19687	7	grumpy
19688	7	Rose is the kind of person who expresses her feelings towards others. In the story it states that Rose and Anna talked and Rose explained how she felt discouraged about her essay. Anna then explains how she hates how their mother works all the time and explains how she lonesomes for Papa . As Anna glared at Rose, Rose states that money isn't everything.
19689	7	Rose is a very selfless person. She works so hard and is being held back by the work she does to support her family. When her aunt asks her if she's weighed down by what she is doing for the family, Rose does not answer in fear of hurting her aunt. This shows, in paragraph 19, Rose is thinking about her family before herself.
19690	7	One trait that describes Rose based on the conversation in the story is she is very responsible.They have their part to do to help Paul finish college.
19691	7	Rose seems quiet because when she is talking to the aunt she does not use very many words.'Rose nodded' Rose seems like she does not like talking to her aunt about her feelings.
19692	7	In the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab you can identify that Rose does not like to let others down. This is shown by her aunt asking her if she is too pressured by what her family is asking her to do, and her not answering, thinking she is going to hurt her aunt if she tells the truth. That is one trait as to how to describe Rose.
19693	7	One trait Rose has based on her conversations is she is self aware, cause she keeps her opions to herself.
19694	7	Rose is sad and heartbroken because her Paul had left her. She was dreaming about him and having flashbacks.
19695	7	She was upste with both of them.
19696	7	From the passage, you can be sure that Rose is a stressed person. She seems to be trying to accomplish many things in her life, all at once, and it's a bit overvearing for her. You know this because of the dream that she had. The imagery of her brother weighing her down probably means that she feels pressure to accomplish what her brother had.
19697	7	Rose is dedicated to helping her family because she works to help her family get money for her brother to go to college and she also helps around the house.
19698	7	That Rose only cares about herself and no one else and she also thinks very heighly of herself. Anna said that money isn't everything then Rose said well if you already have everything.
19699	7	Rose's perseverance is the main trait that I recieve from this story. She is working a 4-hour job after school, she helps with the family work and she's trying to write an essay to keep her brother in collage.
19700	7	One trait that can be described by rose based on her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab is caring. Reason she is best decribed as caring is because she didn't answer her Aunt Kolab cause she knew if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And her aunt would tell her mother.
19701	7	One trait that can describe Rose is she is caring. In her conversation with Anna, they talk about how their mother works late. Rose always has to take care of the family and works. She helps Anna to.
19702	7	When Rose was talking to Aunt Kolab she doesn't want to hurt her feelings, which makes her caring. Whe Aunt Kolab asked her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose says that she doesn't want to tell the truth because she would hurt her Aunt's feelings.
19703	7	Rose is responsible girl who has a lot on her plate for someone of her age.
19704	7	From the conversation with Ana, I can tell that Rose is very undersanding. She is getting things from all points of view. She understand that is is hard on her family to be working so much to put their brother through collage, but she also understands that it is necisarry, and will only last a short time. She knows they are doing it so that they can all have a better future.
19705	7	She is very matture for her age because she has noone home to help with anything and she has to write a three thousand word easy and has to work for herself.
19706	7	Rose knows what she is doing is right. Rose also knows that what she is doing is hard and is putting alot of weight on her. Rose thinks it is tomuch for her to handle. She knows that if both her and Anna work together to help Paul, then Paul will help pay for them to go to college.
19707	7	Based on her conversation with one can tell that Rose understands what her job is in the family. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college'(11). In reading this one can see that Rose knows she has to help Paul graduate from college. If Paul does not graduate then they are doomed. Paul graduating and getting a good job is what will send Rose and Anna to college.
19708	7	Rose cares alot for her family. This is evident in her conversation with her aunt in which she chose not to express her problem so that she would not hurt her Aunts feelings.
19709	7	1) Rose is hardworking. Even though Rose's life is extremely hectic, she tries her best to balance it. With her busy schedule, Rose especially misses her family. Her mother and father never seem to be home to support her. Rose says the whole family is always busy to help make sure Paul goes to college. All of the familly is depending on Paul, once he is out of college, to help them earn money. Rose simply feels weighed down and cannot take the pressure anymore.
19710	7	One trait that describes Rose is stressed.When Aunt Kolab tells her that they might be able to find a better way for her, Rose feels like her life was going to get easier.
19711	7	Rose is very frustrated, becuase it seems that she cannot please everyone and that is starting to wear on her.  When she was talking to  her sister she says that her mother is not home 'again' as if she just wanted things to go back to normal.
19712	7	scared
19713	7	she has perseversance
19714	7	She cares more about others than herslef. She wants to do a bunch of diffrent jobs to raise money for the family
19715	7	One trait about Rose is that she feels like she has to be more responsible. One detail to support this is that she said that Paul's fate lies in her hands.
19716	7	One trait that can be identified about rose is that she is overwhelmed by everything that she does. She has a lot of responsiblities which allows her no time to do the things she needs to do.

19718	7	She feels overwhelmed by all the things she has to do. She worries about school, her job, her life as everything starts to go downhill, and she resents some of the things that she has to do since her father left.
19719	7	She worries a lot about everything. In the story she has a dream about her brother drowning.
19720	7	Rose feel very stressed and she feel that if she tells her aunt that would be disappointed in her.  Then should would possibly tell her mom.  Which would make things worse.
19721	7	Responsible- Rose seems to be more responsible one. She trys to do her best and do what she can to help out her family. She feels like she has to help her brother get through college and she helpsher aunt cook. Her life is complicated but she still works through it.
19722	7	Rose tries to make the best of things.'Only if you already have everything' In this sentence she tries to make her sister laugh when she is upset.
19723	7	scared. she was scared to tell  her aunt the real truth about how she felt
19724	7	Rose is kind of a scared person. When her aunt asked 'Do you feel so weighted down...', Rose didn't answer because she didn't want to be truthful and hurt her aunt's feelings.
19725	7	The one trait could be that she is always busy with work and everything to help pay for all expencines. In pargraph 11 and 12 Anna and Rose are talking of how Rose 'is like her mother', as Anna said. Rose is trying to make money, so she can help pay for Paul's college. When he gets the money he will pay back, as Rose had payed him to go to college.
19726	7	She is hard working.She had school, then work, then helped her aunt, then homerwork.
19727	7	the one trait i would say would be caring how other people feel and lieng to make them feel good
19728	7	Rose is a hard worker, and she has a determined nature. Having such a busy schedule is never easy and doing extra things such as writing an essay for competition would not be easy to handle. Rose balances school, a job, helping cook, and writing an essay, and that takes hard work.
19729	7	Rose has a great work ethic. An example would be when she says 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper'.
19730	7	One trait that describes Rose is caring. In the story when Rose first talks to her sister Anna, she asks her if she feels okay and if everything is allright.

19732	7	Rose is very dedicated to what she is doing. She tries to make everything better with her family so her sister and herself can go to college. This part in the story supports my answer, 'WE have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he will get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19733	7	Rose feels tied down and underpreasure to help her family in the conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab. Paragraph twelve supports my answer because Anna gets upset with Rose.
19734	7	She is very kind and protective of Anna. 'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.
19735	7	Rose is a sympathetic person because she is nice and caring to her sister. Rose talks to Anna 'as gently as she could.'
19736	7	Rose is a hard worker. She puts a lot of wait on her shoulders working for her brother to get through college. She has to write an essay and work. She works herself so hard that she falls asleep easily. She talks with Anna about how even though they are working hard now for their brother one day he will get his own job and do the same for the both of them. When Rose talks with her Aunt she reveals how stressful everything thing is and how she feels everything is weighing her down by everything she is doing for the family. Rose is a hard worker because she is working hard at a young age to help her family's situation.
19737	7	she's depressed, the whole tone of the story is depressing.
19738	7	Rose seems like a depressed woman. She also seems lioke a very nice woman.
19739	7	Rose is a very hard worker. In paragraphs four through seven Rose and Anne have a conversation. Rose explains to Anne how she feel asleep working on her essay.  This and the fact of her job also support the theory that she is a very hard worker.
19740	7	Rose is a very smart person but, she has a downfall on herself and doesn't realize what she can accomplishes when she is in the zone. An example from the story is, she doesn't know what to type her essay on, due to all the stress and feelings she is going through.
19741	7	Rose is a very nice person and also a nice sister. When Anna has a bad dream Rose comforts her and makes sure she is ok. She also talks to Anna and explains to Anna why they live the way they do and also why their father had to go to Los Angeles.
19742	7	Rose is hopeful now. If her Aumt Kolab sew for ladies or made special treats from their country to sell, maybe that will take some of the burden off Rose for awhile.
19743	7	Rosed feared/respected her parents. One detail that supports this is in paragraph 19 when it talks about her not wanting her aunt to tell her mother.
19744	7	Rose is a hard working girl with alot of stuff to do.
19745	7	One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. You can tell this after reading the story because she finished a four hour shift then went home and worked on a 3000 word essay, and told her sister how she fell asleep working on it so she is very hardworking.
19746	7	Rose is caring. She tells Anna in the nicest way possible when she was explaining that Papa had to go to L.A. because the job paid more than he got here.
19747	7	Rose is extremely stubborn.  When she is talking to Anna, she doesn't think about her feelings and ignores what she has to say.  Rose believes that she is right, and whatever Anna says is naive.
19748	7	Rose is responsible. When she was talking to her sister, Anna, she made it her job to explain the situation of their family. Anna later said, 'you sound just like Mama,' proving that Rose feels responsible for those around her.
19749	7	Rosa in this story is careing but shy.
19750	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she likes to get things off her chest, because the dream was weighing her down so she had to talk about it to loosen the grip it had on her.
19751	7	She woke up gasping for air.
19752	7	I can tell that Rose is from Cambodia because the passage says 'Cambodia behind them, the United States before them.' This means that the were from Cambodia and now they are in America.
19753	7	One trait that describes Rosa in this story is desperation. She has been working hard for days trying to be successful. In the conversation with Anna, Rosa 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It appears that she is losing hope and is desperate for something to change.
19754	7	Even though she is over worked and often hates what she does, she still manages to hold herself together.
19755	7	Rose is very worrysome.  The entire time she was talking to Anna her main concern was the work she had to do and simply getting Anna back to bed.
19756	7	Rose is kind of a person that looks at things different than other people do. One trait that describes this is at the begin of the story she is having a conversation wtih her little sister and Rose talks about the money and how it is important but the sister says that basically there are other things more important than just the money.
19757	7	Rose is very busy. She tells Anna that she fell asleep working on her essay.
19758	7	Resentful is what Rose is feeling right now. She is wanting to be back in their first country.She figures they were doing so well there.
19759	7	Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, I can conclude that she is feeling lonely becuase her mother works late and she missed her father who has been gone for years. She feels as though they are also having financial troubles and feels lonely becuase her sister believes everything will be okay when Rose is actually stressed about the situation.
19760	7	Rose seems as if she doesn't get along with her mother quite the way she wants. When Rose says, 'Momma's not home yet is she... I hate how late she has to work.' It seems like she rarely sees her mom and she is lonely.
19761	7	One trait I think Rose has is that she is creative, and she uses her life and her problems to make her essay and find different things to do.
19762	7	Rose is quiet about her misery to anna. She pretends that the burden is light on her by faking a laugh.

19764	7	Rose is very understanding. When she tells her little sister that they have their part to do to help paul finish college.
19765	7	Rose cares and supports what her father is doing for the family. Rose stuck up for her father towards Anna telling her that their father was doing this job for her brother to get out of college and for Anna and herself to be able to go to college.
19766	7	Rose is thoughtful because she seems to think of her family before herself. Anna says she missed her papa. Rose probably misses her dad also but she knows it was a good opportunity for him.
19767	7	Rose is a realist, she knows how the world works and the fact that the money Paul and her father are making are paying for her and Anna's future.
19768	7	Rose was feeling bad for the way Anna was acting, she was more sad to the touch
19769	7	Rose seems to get along with Anna and Aunt Kolab. She cares about her family.
19770	7	She is open to what others have to say about her situations. When she was talking to her aunt she listened and understood what she was saying, which helped her out in the end.
19771	7	Rose is understand and determined. What she has to do may be difficult for her but she know she must for her family.       Even with being so busy and young in her life she still pursues writing the essay when she gets a topic from her own family.
19772	7	One trait of Rose that can describe her based off of her conversations is that she is scared.  One detail from the story would be; Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
19773	7	One trait that can describe Rose is overwhelmed. This is a trait Rose has because in her conversation with Aunt Kolab she asks, 'Do you ever feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That is not a question that someone asks unless what they're doing feels like too much for them.
19774	7	One trait that Rose has is being optimistic in the situation that she's in. This is shown through her conversation with Aunt Kolab, when she draws inspiration for her essay through the bleak situation that the family is in.
19775	7	Crossing over is not hard.

19779	7	A trait that can identify Rose is hard worker.  When she is talking to Aunt Kolab she tells her of the dream. Immediately Aunt Kolab knows what she means.  Rose works hard to do well in school and to earn money at her job to help her family.  Her Aunt can see that and wants to help her through the tough time.

19783	7	Rose is under alot of pressure.Paragraph 3 says she has to write an essay and she's hardly going to be able to do that.

19791	7	upset, when she was talking to her aunt kolab she just ingored what she had to say and stormed out of the kitchen.
19792	7	She feels pressured into doing well in everything she does because if she does not do well it will not help her family. When her aunt asked her is she felt weighed down by what she is doing, Rose could not tell her the truth because yes, she did feel weighed down.
19793	7	Rose is a very deep and caring person who is very compassionate about her family and feels a huge responsibility for the family.From school she had gone straight to the resteraunt for a four hour shift. Then home to prepare a supper, then somehow find time to fit in a three thousand word essay.
19794	7	One trait that describes Rose is overwhelmed. I think she is overwhelmed with all the things she is trying to do for her family on top of an essay she is writting.

After Anna showed her anger towards her father having to go to Los Angeles, Rose said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college'. Rose could've easily allowed her sister's attitude to display the same attitude but instead she kept her feelings hidden, and spoke on the task at hand.

19799	7	Rose is very kind to her Aunt Kolab in their conversation they had. Her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by what she is doing to help their family, but instead of answering she just kept quiet. If she told the truth she knew it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
19800	7	In the conversatin between Rose and Aunt Kolab, Rose proves to be very respectful of her aunt's feelings. For instance, when Aunt Kolab asks if Rose feels weighed down by what she is doing for the family, Rose does not answer for fear of hurting her aunt.
19801	7	One trait that describes Rose is she is resentful.  She feels as if he family is weighing her down.  She wants to tell her Aunt about her dream, but chooses not to.  Rose's Aunt can still tell that there is something wrong and even states 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?'  She realizes what Rose is going through, and wants to help.
19802	7	Rose is a very responsable person Rose works gose to school and helps around the house.
19803	7	As she talks with her Aunt Kolab, Rose appears to be both kind and resilient. Rose thought she could have possibly hurt her Aunt's feelings if she had told the truth about her situation. After Aunt Kolab offers her help, Rose's ability to bounce back from difficult situations is shown as her conversation enables her to begin her essay.
19804	7	Rose tends to receive a lot of pressure through her family and her cultural shock. Her dream explains the pressure that Rose has to go through under her brother's college life.
19805	7	Rose is very understanding. She understands that her Papa had to go somewhere else for a good paying job. She knows it'll be best for her family for him to be getting paid three times as much money as he used to. A detail from the story that supports my answer is when Anna said, 'money isn't everything.' Rose then said, 'only if already have everything.'
19806	7	Rose is easy-going and does not like to talk that much. When she is talking with her sister, she does not talk much her sister does most of the talking. When she is talking with her aunt, she just nodded her head when her aunt would ask her something.
19807	7	Rose is a very caring person.  From the story she says she feels lonley for her dad because it seems like hes been away forever.

19812	7	SHE FEELS SAD AND DEPRESSED THAT SHE CANT SEE PUAL AND HAD A DREAM ABOUT HIM AND AUNT KOLAB HELPS HER OUT WITH IT.
19813	7	hopeful at the end of the story her anut says she can do other things and she gets excited
19814	7	One of Rose's traits would be gratefullness. Rose is overwhelmed with all of the pressure that she is given. She never has any time to relax, and it is starting to take it's toll. Aunt Kolab can see this. 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?' Aunt Kolab asked. Rose respoded by nodding. Rose want to do great things for her family, but she is only a kid. Nevertheless, Rose continues to strive to acheive the best every day of her life to make life easier for her family.
19815	7	Rose is worried about everything that goes on like her essay and Paul in her dream.
19816	7	One of the traits I can think kof right off the bat is that they act the same in some ways in the reading section there is where it says where they are acting alike. But there are some differences so they can't be complety the same.
19817	7	The conversation with her aunt describes her true feelings. such as when her aunt said she can do things that can relate to what they did in their first country. This was an understanding of what was going on in Rose's head
19818	7	Rose likes money too much and is selfish especially when it comes to money. When Anna said, 'Money isn't everything,' Rose said in response, 'Only if you already have everything.'
19819	7	Rose is concerned for her future because when Aunt Kolab says how her situation is difficult in paragraph twenty, Rose agrees and later questions whether things will turn out okay in the future in paragraph twenty-three.
19820	7	She is very emotional about the whole situation of her family.
19821	7	she likes to hide how she realy feels
19822	7	She is kind. She wants to do something to play a role in her family.
19823	7	Rose is a very kind person. When she had her talk with Anna she was trying to be the best person she could and be gentle with her little sister. She wanted to keep Anna away from the conflicts she was feeling. Even though she may have sounded like her mother, according to Anna, Rose just wants to look out for Anna and make her life a little less caotic than hers.
19824	7	Rose is a kind and gentle person,she's  also loving and understaning.     her younger sister walked in rubbing her eyes. 'Anna', Rose said. 'what's wrong? you feel okay?'
19825	7	Rose is caring, because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings by telling her how she really felt.
19826	7	Rose feels overwhelmed by the fact that she has the weight of someone else on her shoulders, as well as herself.  She likes to be able to help others in any way that she can, but now that all the stress has shifted to her, she feels as though it is unfair.
19827	7	She's hopeful and determined. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
19828	7	Rose shows that she has a great deal of determination during her conversation with Anna. Anna is melancholy about the whole situation with their father leaving, their mother working late, and their brother Paul in college trying to finish. However, Rose tells Anna that their father had to leave because he made more money in Los Angeles, and that Paul would soon graduate college and get a good job to pay for their college one day.
19829	7	Rose is lonely, because she said 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'
19830	7	Rose feels loverwhelmed by 'her job to help pay for her brother to finish college.' In paragraph 11 she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'. I think that that paragraph proves that she feels it is her duty to help pay. She seems kind of overwhelmed by everything she has to do also. In the second paragraph the author explains how busy Rose is. It says that she went straight to work after school, and then had to go straight home after a four hour shift to help make dinner. Then she still had homework to do. Rose seems incredibly busy, I know that if I were her I would be extremely overwhelmed all the time.
19831	7	weighed downshe talked to aunt kolab and told her about the dream and said she felt weighted down by what she was doing to help the family.
19832	7	One trait of Rose is that she is a busy caring girl. She had went to school, worked a four-hour shift, then had to write a three-thousand word essay. She started off talking to her sister by asking her sister if she was okay.
19833	7	Rose feels overworked and stressed out because she has to work and go to school. When she is talking to Anna she feels she has to keep her feelings inside her so as to not upset her.
19834	7	Rose is a caring person.  Details from the story that support this are when her sister walks into the kitchen she asks her if she is okay and trys to comfort her. Another example of Rose being caring is when she is talking to her aunt and she says that she doesnt want to hurt her aunt's feelings when she told her she felt weighted down by the family.
19835	7	Rose is a very resentful person. She clearly is not pleased with her current situation. Her dream (paragraph 15) proves this. She feels resent because paul is figuratively 'drowning' her.
19836	7	HER TRAIT IS THAT SHE HAS TO RELATE TO SUMTHING LIKE SHE HAD TO RELATE TO HER DREAM.
19837	7	Rose is a very stressed person. She is trying to help her family make it but it is making her feel so stressed that she falls asleep trying to work on an essay.
19838	7	Hard-workingFrom school she'd gone straight to the restaraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.
19839	7	Rose to me seems like the one that has to take care of her family. She is the new headstrong woman that has to watch over her family and has to do anything to keep her family together. An example would be by her writing the essay to help her and her sister to go to Sacremento to help her brother. She feels that if she does not win the contest, then she will fail and disappoint her sister. She wants to help out her family and try to support them anyway that she can.
19840	7	Rose is family oriented. She tries to encourage Anna to not be upset that her father is gone, because he's trying to help out Paul who will then in return, help Rose and Anna out when they try to pay for schooling. Rose seems to love her family and want them all happy.
19841	7	Rose, in the story 'Crossing Over', is an intricate character, however one important trait that is emphasized in this excerpt is  responsibility. Rose shows responsibility in many ways. One of them is how she goes to work at a resturant after school to support her family. This is a big responsibility for Rose and she shoulders it well. Rose proves just how responsible she is by doing this job.
19842	7	One trait that I think can describe Rose is stressed.  She has to deal with family issues, school, work, and other responsibilities at a young age.  Anna doesn't understand what all has to be done for their family. She gets mad over everything. Rose accepts everything and takes the responsibility.  Yet, Rose is so stressed that she has a dream of her brother drownding her.
19843	7	Rose takes great responsibilty in her family. In her conversation with Anna she tries to provide some hope for her younger sister. In reality the reader can see her true feelings of being overwhelmed. In her conversation with her aunt, Rose hesitates to explain her feelings because she does not want to hurt her Aunt. She comes to realize that responsibilty is important but one  can recieve help as well.
19844	7	one trait to discribe rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is how she doesnt really say any thing that will hert her family. This is seen in paragrah 19 when it says ' If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'.
19845	7	Rose has perserverance. Rose keeps on tryng even though she is in a tough situation. ' I fell asleep working on my essay' shows that Rose trys very hard.
19846	7	Rose in a way she doesnt seem to care much about what others have to say. She didn't give much comfort about Anna being upset about her husbands death 4 months ago. Towards the end of the story, Anna was talking and Rose wasnt saying anything she just kept nodding her head like she had nothing to say. Her aunt asked her a question also and she didn't answer because she didn't want to tell the truth.
19847	7	Aunt Kolab enjoys serving others (=
19848	7	She is a very hard-working worker.  The author said so because she works all the time.
19849	7	One trait would be that she really likes money.Anna saying that 'Money isn't everything.' would be one detail from the story.
19850	7	Rose loyal because through all the stuff she has on her shoulders she still does what her aunt tells her to like working at the store.
19851	7	One trait that describes Rose is that she is very understanding, and does not like to hurt other people's feelings. One detail from the story that supports Rose not wanting to hurt people's feeling is when Rose was talking to her aunt and she did not answer, because she felt that if she told the truth, she would of hurt her aunt. That's in paragraph 19.
19852	7	In Rose's converstaion with Aunt Kolab, the reader can see that Rose is a caring person.  When Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighted down by helping the family, Rose didn't answer.  She didnt answer so she wouldn't hurt Aunt Kolab's  feelings or her mother's feelings.  Instead of being selfish and letting out all her frustration in answering the question, Rose kept her hurtful thoughts inside because she knew it would hurt her mother.
19853	7	Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, she feels like she must be the mature one. She knows what to say, even when it's not how she actually feels. While Anna was complaining about their situation, Rose responded by saying everything was fine and that things would get better. In reality, Rose felt the same way as Anna.
19854	7	One trait that I see in Rose is jelousy. When she says to her sister Anna, 'Only if you already have everything.' shows she is does not like that her brother is already graduated highschool and is in collage.
19855	7	They have some dreams and some flashbake of some of the same things.
19856	7	One trait that describes Rose would be hard-working.  She is hard-working because the story tells us that she has to work a job, take care of her family, and write an essay.

19862	7	Rose talks with Anna very caringly. They talk about their mother working really late, and Anna is upset about it. But Rose assures Anna that her mother is working hard so they can have a good life. Rose is a very caring character and it is portrayed throughout her conversation with Anna.
19863	7	Rose is very sincere and caring. Rose is willing to protect and look out for any and all family members. Though she misses Cambodian traditions and their sense of family, Rose is willing to help revive and bring back those lost memories. Rose has a conversation with her aunt towards the end of the story, and this shows that Rose listens to her aunt and willing to take her advice. Rose has also found her topic for her essay, because she opened her eyes and found what she had lost sight of; her family.
19864	7	Depressed.  she kept nodding not answering to her aunt.
19865	7	They are worried of how life is going on. Its not going on pretti good for them, even thoug they are still trying to get out of the whole in wich they are in. they have efaith in their brother getting a good job after his graduation so he can support them and pay for his sisters college. An example from the story would be when her sister Anna or her Aunt Kolab talk to her about the situation they are in and Rose always thinks about how much she haes goin on with her busy life.
19866	7	Hard worker. Rose falls asleep while writing her essay because she was staying up late to get it done.
19867	7	Rose is resentful for having to work to support the family. She does not want to have to work all the time to pay for Paul to get through college. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college,' Anna said. Then Rose stalked out of the kitchen proving that she does not agree.
19868	7	When Anna talks to her aunt, the aunt asked if she feels overwelmed by what you do for the family. In this whole talk with the aunt Anna shows the trait that she has to be the leader now that her brother is gone. Anna feels that she has to do everything, but is overwelmed with all the respnsibility at the same time. Her aunt tries to help her, by saying we can find a better way for you. This meaning a better way so she doesn't have to take all the responsibility for the family.
19869	7	Rose is a hard worker, she goes to school, helps her family and holds a job at a restaurant.
19870	7	Rose seems to be a responisble young lady. She has to work to support her family, along with everything else every teenager has to do. She goes to school, watches over her sister, and in this particular situationg, has to write a three-thousand-word essay. As she talks to her aunt near the end of the story, her aunt can tell she feels weighed down with all of the responsibility placed onto her.
19871	7	Rose helps others before herself. You can tell because when she is talking to Anna about how much she cares about other people. She never once says anything concieded about herself.
19872	7	Rose can be described by calling her a leader. When her parents left she took over charge of the family. She took good care of them and was very generous.
19873	7	One of Rose's traits is optimism. While talking with Anna, Rose tries to make her feel better about their father living somewhere else, their mother being at work, and their brother being at college. Rose tries her best to be positive in everything she says.

19876	7	Rose is considerate about the people around her and how they might feel if she said the wrong thing to them. In the story Aunt Kolab asked Rose a question but Rose didn't answer because she was affraid how her aunt would feel.
19877	7	In the conversation Rose is nodding and not wanting to say anything back because she says in the story that she is afraid that she would hurt her aunt and that her aunt would tell her mom if she answered truthfully. So she feels that she can't tell the truth to her. This shows a trait of concern and compassion for her aunt and mom, and what they think of her.
19878	7	One trait that Rose has is caring. There are many others that she shows but caring is one of the main ones. When her sister Anna came downstairs to get a drink of water Rose asked if she was okay. Just by taking the time to ask her little sister that shows that she has a caring personality and truly cares about her sister.
19879	7	Rose is hardworking. Rose has a job that has a four hour shift.
19880	7	Rose is very weighed down about alot of things in her life. Including work, school, nd family situations. In paragraph eighteen, it starts to explain to us the feelings about Rose.
19881	7	Rose is caring. When Rose is talking to her aunt she doesn't want to reveal that she is weighed down by what she was doing for her family because it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
19882	7	'It's only been four months,' Rose said as genty as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'Caring. She was caring in the fact that she tried to make her sister feel better and explain why he left.
19883	7	Motherly, she seems to be like a mother to Anna because their mom has to work so late. I feel that Anna sees Rose as a mother through the way Rose comforts Anna in the kitchen.
19884	7	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab is telling her that the truth that might hurt her feelings and that her mom would tell her the same thing. The truth hurts sometimes.
19885	7	She is jealous of people who have money. When Anna said 'Money isn't everything' Rose said 'Only if you already have everything.
19886	7	Based on Rose's conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose seems to have an insecure personality. Rose is constantly feeling busy and stressed from what she has to do to help the family. She is not very confident when it comes to what she does to help. She seems to feel as if she is never doing good enough, although she tries as hard as she can. After the talk with her aunt, she is easily convinced and determined that her life could possibly get easier.
19887	7	One trait that can describe Rose is 'pessimistic'. Rose doesn't think she can finish her three-thousand-word essay, and then thinks that, even if she could, she wouldn't be able to go to Sacramento for the prize. She is hopeless.
19888	7	Rose's traits that are shown in the conversation with Aunt Kolab. One trait that can be described in the passage is that, she didn't want to tell her Aunt how she was feeling being weighed down by what she was doing to help her family. She was keeping her feelings to herself becasue she didn't want to tell Aunt Kolab and then she would tell her mother.
19889	7	Rose is optimistic. This is shown in her conversation with Anna. When Rose says, 'only if you already have everything,' shows how Rose likes to think on the brighter side. Suggesting that the only reason he father left was because he already has everything at home, just not enough money.
19890	7	Rose is caring. She doesn't tell her aunt  she discouraged when her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She doesn't answer so she won't hurt her aunt or mother. Also, when her sister comes down, she asks her,'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
19891	7	She is frustrated with her life. Rose feels too busy with all that she has to do for her family. Her days are jam-packed with everything that she has to do, including, school, a job, elping around the house, and homework.
19892	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she pretends to be optimisitic about the situation that she and her sister are in but sub consciencely she doubts how her plans will unfold. Like in her conversation with Anna when she seemed so sure that her brother was going to put her and her sister through college but by reading it you can tell that inside she doubts what she says.
19893	7	Rose is an understanding person. This is shown in her conversation with Anna when she says that her father 'had to go.' She understands that the new job he has pays a lot more than his previous one, and that it makes it easier when her father is making more money.
19894	7	She is very nice and does not like to cause trouble. This is shown when her aunt asked her if her family made her feel weighed down and she didnt answer.
19895	7	Rose identifies that she dosent like how the relationship in the family is and that she is lonely. 'I hate how late she has to work.' is the prime example of this situation.
19896	7	that she thinks everything is going to be alright and that she told anna that when paul finishes college then he would have a great job and he would pay for college for anna and rose
19897	7	Rose is a very nice girl. She is very discouraged though when she thinks about everything going on in her life and how busy she is. She is upset with a few things but she doesn't want many people knowing exactly how she feels because she doesn't want the attention of other people feeling bad for her. In paragraph 19, Rose didn't answer her aunt because 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother'. This shows that she doesn't want to hurt anyones feelings or have them feel sorry for her. She can cope with these feelings mostly on her own.
19898	7	Rose is an extremely strong, selfless individual who places the needs and emotions of her family before her own. As Rose talks to Anna in the kitchen, she forces an assured, hopeful response in order to diminsh Anna's concerns even though she is worried herself.
19899	7	Rose is very hard working and respects her family. You can tell this when her aunt asks her how she feels she doesnt answer.
19900	7	She said she would feel guilty if she answered yes to her aunts question about Rose working to support the family and if it made her feel weighed down.
19901	7	Keep it banaged and wrapped.  Don't try to do anything too stenguous with your hand for a little while.
19902	7	One trait that Rose exemplifies is the loyalty she shows towards her family. Although she has school, work, and family to juggle she knows that she just can't give up and she has to help her family no matter how tough everything gets.
19903	7	Rose is the type of person where she kind of matures at a faster rate due to the situation that her family is in right now. For example, everyone in the family is contributing to Paul going to college so that he can get a good paying job so that he can support the family. Rose can easily understand this better than Anna can because she is older. The conversation that Rose had with Anna proves the maturity, understanding, and the responsibilty that she has taken upon herself to make Anna understand this. The conversation with Aunt Kolab proves that she has enough wisdom and common sense to hold her tongue which proves that she has enough maturity and wisdom. She was able to take full responsibilty of a situation that was out of her control and able to complete the task without little complaint, while still holding a strong front.
19904	7	Rose is very weighted in the sense that not only does she have to tend to her own needs, but that she has to help support another family. She also has to deal with the fact that neither of her parents are home too much. Just the fact that in the beginning she could not stay awake supports the idea of how hectic her life is.
19905	7	she thinks everyone will get everything for ever...'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19906	7	Rose is a determined person. She helps me figure that out when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
19907	7	In the passage Rose seems very caring and loving, really cares about others. She is concerned about Anna in the passage line 5 shows that she asks her sister Anna what's wrong and if she feels okay.
19908	7	One trait that I found in Rose is that she is very reserved in her thoughts and feelings. She has these dreams that are very disturbing, and very sad. These dreams reflect her true emotions, and describe her internal conflicts. It seems that through her own experiences and heart-aches, she weighs herself down by letting everything build up in her heart, mind, and soul. Finally, however, she reveals her dream to her aunt. When this happened, her aunt began to understand her, and you could literally feel the weight being lifted off of Rose's shoulders.
19909	7	Rose does not want the rest of her family to know her true feelings.  This may be out of a desire to not hurt her family.  In Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, she asks Rose if she feels 'weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.'  Rose doesn't say anything in order to keep from insulting her aunt.  If she had said yes Rose would have sounded lazy and disrespectful.
19910	7	That rose is a person who thinks to much about what is going to happen and flashing back to the future and making a relation.
19911	7	One of the trait that Rose has is that she is very caring person. In the line 4~12, eventhough Anna kept repelling Rose's opinion, she didn't get mad or abything. But she simply talked to her so tha Anna could understand.
19912	7	She felt like she didnt have a easy life because according to paragraph 23 , they said maybe her life would get easier .
19913	7	IM IN THE COMPUTR
19914	7	Rose is gentle. She tells her little sister that their dad has only been gone for three months and its for the best.
19915	7	She has a lot of pressure on her shoulders to support her family.'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' her aunt said, but she didn't answer because she knew it was true.
19916	7	From what this story tells, Rose is a caring person.  She tries to talk to her little sister about their dad and why he had to leave.  She cares about how Anna feels and that is important to her.
19917	7	Rose is a hard worker and does anything she can to help out her family. 'From school she'd gone straight to the resaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
19918	7	Anna is considerate of other's feelings.  For example; when Anna had her dream that Paul was weighing her down she didn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab for fear that it would hurt her aunt's and her mother's feelings.
19919	7	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab could be that Rose is very worried. One detail from the story that supports my answer would be that when talking about her essay, she knows that she does not have enough time to complete the essay and that she does not want to lose her job.
19920	7	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is very understanding and willing to try and find a way to make a situation better. In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, her Aunt was making suggestions on ways that she can take over some of the things that Rose does all the time. Rose seemed very open to changing and grateful that her Aunt was offering to make her life a little better.
19921	7	Rose cares for her family. She felt too young for so much responsibility.
19922	7	Rose is very respectful of authority.  She felt very weighed down with responsibility to help the family, but she did not complain, even when Anna was expressing how she felt about Papa leaving, Rose stood up for her father, even though she felt the same way.
19923	7	she seems to understand the importance of life. 'Rose kept nodding. maybe her life would get easier'
19924	7	Rose is a honest person who tells the truth. In the line 20, 'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes as you should, I suppose, because you gree wp here...This must bhe difficult for you. Yes?', Aunt Kolab asks Rose a question and Rose answers it honestly.
19925	7	Anna said that Rose is like her mother because she says they same things their mother has said. 'You sound just like Mama.'
19926	7	I'm guessing Rose is a very hard working and responsible young lady. Even though she has a thousand and one things on her plate the story tells how she gets up for school every morning, works hard, works after school, helps her aunt cook, and then does her homework before bed.
19927	7	She doesn't give up, she is a hard worker and knows what she wants and that the work she does brings her closer to that goal. Like when she was very tired and could have easily just laid back down and fell asleep, she instead woke up to start her three-thousand-word essay.
19928	7	rose didn't answer.
19929	7	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is concern. Rose has concern about everyone in the family and is trying to do everything she can to help them. However seeing she is only a kid she explains that to her Aunt who agrees that maybe they should find some other alternative.
19930	7	In the story Rose seems to be very informative, and also caring, because she is going through so much trouble to help out her brother and her family.  The quote 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.', shows that she is very trusting, and hopefull as well.
19931	7	Throughout the passage of 'Crossing Over', Rose consistently suppresses her fear and burdens to show a sense of strength and optimism to her fellow family members.  When Rose converses with Anna, she explains that they must do their best to help the family, even though Rose feels the same burdens as Anna.
19932	7	Rose and Aunt Kolab are very close that Rose can tell her anything like her dream she had. Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
19933	7	I fell asleep working on my essay
19934	7	One trait that I think that Rose has is that she cares about her family. She said that they have to do their part to help Paul finish college.
19935	7	Rose is very sensitive. She trys to make the rest of the family feel better although she is in pain to. You can tell that she misses her father just as much as Anne and Aunt Kolab does. She just trys to hide it so everyone else doesn't get hurt by it.
19936	7	Rose is tired of her family. She doesn't like that she has to work all the time for her brother. She don't get anytime to herself. She is worried about her family and she is always busy.
19937	7	Rose is undersanding. Her life is hard, with all of her responsibilities around the house, but she knows that there is nothing she can do to change the situation. So even though she complains about it to her sister, she still does what is needed of her.
19938	7	Rose feels very stressed going from school to work, then from work to home.
19939	7	1. Rose feels weighed down by her family. This is revealed in her conversation with Aunt Kolab.
19940	7	Rose is very caring and helping, but she keeps everything to herself. Rose helps the family out, in ervy way possible, she hardly ever leaves time for her own homework. Rose is so busy and stressed that she never tells anyone that she feels so weighed down by what she's doing to help teh family. For example, when Aunt Kolab was talking to her and asked her if she felt weighed done by what she's doing for the family, Rose was afraid to tell her yes because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
19941	7	Rose is sincere and loveing to her sister becasue Rose questions Anna and says 'Anna, Whats wrong? You feel okay?'
19942	7	SelflessShe realizes that if she told Aunt Kolab what she really felt, she would dissapoint her family.
19943	7	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is responsible for her age and she doesn't want to let the family down.
19944	7	Rose is very selfless. When Rose is talking with Aunt Kolab her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by her family, Rose doesn't want to answer because she didn't want to hurt her aunt.
19945	7	She is very sympathetic and responsible.  In the story, when she talks to Anna, she does not berrate her or talk down to her in any way, but instead is supportive and nuturing.  Also, she has many responsibilities and tasks to support the family, another example of how she is sympathetic and responsible.
19946	7	tired lonely boring
19947	7	Rose woke gaspong for air. The walls of her room were bathed in pale sunlight. She has bad dreams alot and is calmed down when she sees the sunlight on her walls.
19948	7	Rose feels like she has to take care of everything, and that her sister doesn't do anything. Rose doesnt like to make conflict but its hard for her to have to take care of everything including her sister. Anna makes it harder on her sister because is isnt grateful for anything she has 'only if you already have everything,' Rose says as a snaps at Anna, but she still tries to cover it up with a fake laugh.
19949	7	Rose seems like she likes to have a lot to do and she's always busy. She even says that she's so busy that she forgot about her essay.
19950	7	1) Rose wants to seem strong for her sister but she is worried tat everything that was promised to her wont happen. She also feels pressured to get Paul through college. The detail is that she feels too young for so much responibility and she imagined how her brother feels being only 3 years older than her and he determines the fate of his two little sisters.
19951	7	Rose is afraid of sharing her feelings. She doesn't tell her aunt the truth in spite of hurting her and so that her aunt doesn't tell her mother.
19952	7	Rose is hardworking and will do whatever it takes to help out her family. This is shown by her schedule wher she goes straight from school to work a four hour shift at a restaurant, and then from there to home where she helps make a quick supper and does her homework.
22351	8	Paul felt bad for Mr. Leonard because he was good in track and none of the colleges wanted him because he could not read. Paul could not read also, he is getting help from the Learning Center.
22352	8	It maks him wanna work harder and maks him wanna do it
22353	8	The effect of the background information that the narrator has on paul Mr. Leonard is knowing that in his past he used to be a high school track and feild champion.
22354	8	You could tell that Paul had experienced some of the same feelings Mr. Leonard had experienced back when he was in school. When Mr. Leonard told Paul about how he flunked out of college that not only gave Paul the want to excel in track but also in school. Then at the end of the story when Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time to start his training it also shows that Paul is thankful that Mr. Leonard helped him realize his potential and ow he wanted to help Mr. Leonard realize his.
22355	8	Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about being a great track runner who broke records. He is curious about what happened to him. When Mr. Loenard tells him his story, Paul is surprised but he can relate. He says, 'His words were all too familiar to me.' Mr. Leonard gave Paul his time to help hime excel at something and when he realizes this, Paul wants to help him excel at something too. He says, 'Let's start your training.'
22356	8	When Paul learned about Mr. Leonard's background information. He was suprised, because the man broke records at the nationals. When he was a freshmen in college. Plus he also coulden't read and thats why he lost his scholarship and flunked out. So he wanted to help Paul take the right path.
22357	8	He asked have he went to college and paul didnt know about college.
22358	8	I believe that the background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard was encouraging to Paul because now Paul realizes how alike he and Mr. Leonard are. They both have trouble reading. He also knows that now he can help him with something in return for Mr. Leonard helping Paul with running.
22359	8	Paul probly thinks that him and Mr. Leonard are not that different beacuse Paul dont know how to read and when Mr Leonard did hurdles he did not know how to read either. Paul was always picked last for games in gym and now Mr Leonard got him into the hurdles and Paul is good at it.
22360	8	Nathan     The background iformation has somewhat of a strong inluence on Paul. It gets Paul to try harder at becoming an athlete along with trying to improve his reading skills. It also makes Paul relate more to Mr. Leonard and makes Paul decide to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22361	8	He didn't know that his coah was a record breaking star, and also didn't know that they were so alike, Mr. Leonard was a bad reader also and that gave something that the narrator could relate to.
22362	8	Paul realizes that without being able to read, there is no way that he can succeed in life to the extent that he wishes. Because of this realization, Paul becomes motivated to learn how to read to alow him to do better in school and get a good edjucation, thus allowing him to succeed.
22363	8	well paul is just like Mr.leonard he cant read and is pretty good at track.  he says all of Mr.lenoards were all to familiar to me.  i knew them well feeling embarrassment when people new all the other answer but he didnt
22364	8	Paul is bothered by the background he gets on Mr. Leonard.  He doesn't understand why his track coach said anything about how great of a track coach he was.  Paul did not relize that his coach was trying to hide the fact that he was not good at reading.
22365	8	When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard's background information he was very interested. He asked why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his accomplishments. Paul felt empathy for Mr. Leonard because he was felt his embarrassment when asked to read aloud in front of people, and not having the ability.
22366	8	During the story, Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard used to be a hurdler himself, that in fact Mr. Leonard was very talented at the 400 hurdles by winning the nationals and breaking records. Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard struggled in school and although he did try to learn, it always seemed to difficult for him to do. So, when offered a scholarship for track ( his hurdling), Mr. Leonard was told that he was going to do just fine in school and that he would be provided with help. Instead of improving his grades, Mr. Leonard found that college was much more of a challenge that high school, thus eventually causing him to flunk out of it.      In learning this information, Paul immediately understood why Mr. Leonard had wanted to and had been training him in hurdling. He knew that Mr. Leonard wanted to teach Paul that with hard work and motivation, he could do anything. That he should not be embarrassed that he struggles in school because he can overcome the challenge. Paul was honored and thankful for what Mr. Leonard had done, and it drove him to feel like he shoud in return teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
22367	8	The effect that the background information has on Paul is he was surprised that he was a sports man himself. and that he had to flunk out of school.
22368	8	The background information that he learns about Mr. Leonard strives him because they are alike because they are both poor readers. Mr. Leonard was on a track team in college and set records and Paul could go just as far as he did.
22369	8	it helps me find out more about him so i can comprehind the story better.
22370	8	I think when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 in college and set records, he couldn't believe it and was just shocked I suppose. And then when Paul found out that the college had flunked Mr. Leonard for not being able to read he related himself to Mr. Leonard and decided he wanted to help him learn how to read so maybe he could have that opportunity to be successful in college again.
22371	8	Paul find out that Mr. Leonard had the same problem as he did back when he was in school. Since Paul is doing better in school he wants to help out Mr. Leonard.
22372	8	At the end of the story Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more similar to him than he thought, being unable to read as well. Mr. Leonard went all the way to the collegiate level, but then flunked out due to school problems. Paul could relate to this challenge with school, but having learned the result of Mr. Leonard's college career, he is now motivated to study harder. In the end Mr. Leonard helps Paul with hurdles, and in return the story foreshadows the likely hood of Paul helping Mr. Leonard with reading.
22373	8	Even through the whole time with Mr. Leonard knew Paul .paul was always uo to something. Mr. Leonard knew that Paul was having diffuculties learner and reading so that was why Paul was at the center to begin with. He also knows that Paul dropped out off college and she he has accomplished alot.
22374	8	Paul was the same way and had trouble reading as Mr. Leonard did. Meaning they both understand what its like to not be a good reader or student. Paul gives an example and why its bad and says ' Feelimg of embarassment when i was called called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everone else knew'.
22375	8	In the story Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an amazing college track-star that won 400 metals in his freshman year. Later he also learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Paul could connect with him this way and it also motivated Paul to try his best at the hurdles. The background information on Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to try his best at everything he does no matter the circumstances.
22376	8	Mr. Leonard cannot read and Paul can't either. When Paul finds out that he cannot read and it caused him to flunk out of college it makes him want to help Mr. Leonard and to coach him to get better at reading just like he has helped him get better at track.
22377	8	The information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard was important because Paul really got to understand why Mr. Leonard asked questions like 'Whats your name?' even though for the last week Mr. Leonard has been checking his hall pass. Paul also got to understand why Mr. Leonard was taking him out to the track he wanted him to know that with practice you can over come anything.
22378	8	He finds out Mr. leonard was an old track star for a college he went to when he was younger, which made paul want to try harder to be like Mr. Leonard.  He wanted to become a great track runner and accomplish what Mr. Leonard counld not.
22379	8	He is surprised and a bit comfused. He doesn't understand why he had quit when he was such a good athlete, but after everything is explained he understands that he needs to do better in school to be able to do the things that he is good at (witch is track).
22380	8	Paul wounders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him he was a track star. Paul finds that through the coach. paul was thrilled to see what Mr. Leonard was back in the day.
22381	8	The information that Paul learns makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard stop doing track. This brings up a conversation that started in paragraph 35.      During the conversation Paul learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he couldn't read. This information makes Paul feel compasion for Mr. Leonard because they have the same problem and decides to help him learn to read.
22382	8	It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard had the same things going on as he did through out high school and college. It showed Paul that he was not a good reader as well.
22383	8	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background, he is first angered. He thought that he should have told him. He later finds out that Mr. Leonard kept this from him because he didnt want to tell him about the flunking out of college. He was embarrassed but at the same time Paul knew exactly how he had felt because they both have gone through the same thing.
22384	8	Paul want to help Mr. Leonard start reading. Paul was hurt to see that Mr. Leonard didn't make it into college because he couldn't read, so not be able to read shut Mr. Leonard's career down. So paul wanted to help him learn how to read.
22385	8	I think that Paul was confused why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about him when he won the 400 meter hurdle when he was a freshman in school. But after Paul found out why he didn't tell him then he thinks that when Mr. Leonard was just like him. Because both of them have reading problems and Mr. Leonard wasn't able to forfill his dream because he didn't have anyone to help him in reading. Thrn he lost his scholarship and he flunked out of college. But Mr. Leonard don't want him to do the same as he did. So he was trying to get Paul motivated to do something.
22386	8	He wanted to know what he was back when he was in collage so he came out and ask him beacuse they became pretty close as they worked with each other for a while.
22387	8	The effect that the backround information has on Paul causes him to want to help Mr. Leonard succed in his own flaws to give back to what Mr. Leanard has given Paul, success. ' This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
22388	8	When Pual discovers why Mr. Leonard helped him, he wants to help Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard couldn't read, just like Pual and he felt empathetic for him and knew if he could learn to hurdle, Mr. Leonard could learn to read.
22389	8	As the story progresses, Paul slowly learnes about Mr. Leonard--leading to a small confrontation as to why the hall monitor never told Paul about his successes in track and field.  Paul appears amazed at the news; however, he also is slightly confused as to why Mr. Leonard had never mentioned it before.  When Mr. Leonard explains his problem with learning, Paul understands the feeling.  In Paragraph 45, he connects with them--the embarrassment of not being able to read--and, symphasizing, offers to 'train' Mr. Leonard in schoolwork.  Throughout this time Paul and Mr. Leonard become friends, easily understanding one another from similar experiences.
22390	8	checked hall pass
22391	8	Paul haves trouble with reading, but Mr. Leanord thinks that Paul could be a good track star. He didn't want Paul to go to college and flunk out of it because he can't read real well. Mr. Leanord is making Paul run track to excel in his work.
22392	8	He starts to learn more details about Mr. Leonard and why he wants to train Paul.
22393	8	When Paul discovered the information, he realized that he and Mr. Leonard were more alike than he had thought. He found that Mr. Leonard could not read well during college and could not keep participating in hurdles if he couldn't bring his grades up. When he first went to college the scouts told him that his grades weren't important, but he soon realized, upon flunking, that his grades did matter. When Paul heard Mr. Leonards story, he could relate to the familiar feelings of embarassment of not being able to read. He realized that Mr. Leonard had taken time to help him unconditionaly and that he should do what he can to make Mr. Leonard live out his dream.
22394	8	The effect that the background information Paul has on Mr. Leonard is very benificial on Paul. That information about how Mr. Leonard cannot read connects to Paul because he cannot read himself. Paul then thinks that him and Mr. Leonard have a lot of the same problems.
22395	8	Mr.Leonard's background information had a great effect on Paul in the text it says 'feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know the answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' At this point Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt not being able to achieve something but was great at something else because, Paul's been in the same situation so he wants to help Mr.Leonard and train him to learn how to read.
22396	8	When Mr. Leonard shares his past experience with Paul, he feels connected to his emotions.  Paul says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment whe I was called upon...'(46-47).  Paul knew that he should not be discouraged by the fact that to get in to college he would have to be athletic and smart.  Mr. Leonard let him know that with help he can overcome any obstacle in his way.
22397	8	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's success in highschool and college as a hurdler track star and he also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read made Paul feel sympathetic towards him. Paul knows how it must have felt not being able to read and failing classes, since Paul himself can not read and he understands the embarassement. So when Paul finds this all out he decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22398	8	Paul was wondering why Mr. Leonard did not mention this to him earlyer. He wanted to know why he stopped and what happened to him. I think that this inpired paul that just because you cant read does not mean you cant do other things.
22399	8	it encourages him to help coach do his dream and achieve something that slipped away from him years ago.
22400	8	At first, Paul is confused when he says, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul doesn't know why Mr. Leonard would hide this information from him.  He is patient, however, and waits for Mr. Leonard's response before jumping to conclusions.  After he hears Mr. Leonard's story, his is empathetic with Mr. Leonard because he can't read.  Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to overcome his obstacles and to learn the hurdles.
22401	8	Paul relates to the background information about Mr. Leonard. They both had issues in school with reading.
22402	8	It has not that big of a effect because in the story it says how he was used to listening to people so background  information would not change him at all.
22403	8	Paul knows all to well thous feelings, shame, embarisment and the frustration from not knowing how to reed. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was and is in just about the same boat as him he feels for him and wants to help him like he helped him at sports by teaching him to reed better.
22404	8	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes him under stand Mr. Leonard better and it helps him understand why he did what he did in the first place. Mr. Leonard was just trying to help the kid out because he was in that same situation in school.
22405	8	During the story the reader is given background information about Mr. Leonard, this information has an effect on Paul. Paul is effected by this background information when he finds out about the past, about Mr. Leonard excelling in track, but then loosing his college track chance due to the fact that he could't read. Paul later realizes that he has bennifitted because he is getting help with his reading, and now he knows that he can be tallented in something else. This caused Paul to tell Mr. Leonard at the end of the story, 'It's time to start your training.' This gave the reader the impression that Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
22406	8	The effect that this information has on Paul is that he gains more respect and understanding for Mr. Leonard because he's impressed by his athletic history and he thinks Mr. Leonard is a generally nice man who has experienced a lot of things in his lifetime. Mr. Leonard becomes a figure to Paul that deserves respect because they are similar, but Mr. Leonard recognizes his mistakes in life and the advice that he gives to Paul is relevant because Paul is experiencing the same thing.
22407	8	The effect that having background information on Mr. Leonard is that he relates and understands Paul. For example, when the reader learns that Mr. Leonard also cannot read, Paul understands that same embarrassment that Mr. Leonard feels. Also, Mr. Leonard being an ex-runner gives Paul more confidence that he is in good hands learning to get better at track.
22408	8	The background information it has on Paul, is it encourages him to become better at the hurdles. Also, he wants to be great athlete just like Leonard. Another effect, it has Paul is he looks at Mr. Leonard as a person to look up to. Last effect, is Paul should accomplish all of his goals and become better as an athlete.
22409	8	the backgound is the differnt places were the the people have been. like some people will have a scholrship and flunked out of school witch is relly bad to do.
22410	8	At first, I think that Paul was surprised that Mr. Grabowski didn't tell him about it, so that's why he asked him why he didn't tell Paul about it. It made Paul realize that no matter what he can do anything that he sets his mind to. Paul was so grateful to Mr. Grabowski that he had taken the time and gave him the opportunity be great at something, that he wanted to return the favor and help Mr. Grabowski out as well.
22411	8	Paul is able to see how similar he and Mr. Leonard are after learning his background information. The effect this has on Paul causes him to want to do the same thing for Mr. Leonard as he had done for Paul.
22412	8	The effect of Mr. Leonard's background is that Paul cannot read just like Mr. Leonard couldn't. Mr. Leonard says in Paragraph 44 'No school wanted a runner that couldn't read.'
22413	8	Paul thinks that it is good that he was a runner in college and so what if he didnt graduate college he was still a really good runner. Schools now days will help him in the learning area while he does good on the track.
22414	8	When Paul finds out about the coach he confronts him. When Mr. Leonard says he can't read, the narrator finally realizes why he had to ask him his name even though it was on his hall pass. The narrator then takes Mr. Leonard to the school to start his reading training. It makes Paul more determined.
22415	8	The kid did the research to check and see what his coach meant. He did and found some thing he never would of thought. his training coach was a respected and well know runner. by going to collage as a freshman and going to natinals and winning the four hundrid meter hurdles and winning.
22416	8	He is a little concerned because Mr. Leonard dropped out of collage. He wasn't really sure on trusting him or not.
22417	8	It supprises him because Mr. Leonard is just like him.
22418	8	It makes Paul realize that you can overcome obsticals no matter what problems you have.
22419	8	The background information on Mr. Leonard effected Paul by feeling more connected to his couch. Since Paul then knew about Mr. Leonard's past and struggle with reading, he realized that Mr. Leonard was trying to make Paul as good of a runner as he was but also with the right education to go far with his talent.
22420	8	During the story, 'Gifts' the narrator was one of the select few who had to take a remedial reading program. Later on after he got track practice from Mr. Leonard and was told to look up a URL for a track and field website, Paul found out that it was his trainer. He then found out about Mr. Leonard's past and how he was not a good student which reflects on Paul and that gives him the strength to help Mr. Leonard with his training.
22421	8	Paul is happy to that he is not the only person who has trouble reading. When Paul was told about the website he went to Mr. Leonard and asked why did you hide this. Come to fined out Mr. Leonard couldn't read and thats why he couldn't stay in college.
22422	8	The background information that Paul read on the website that the track and field coach gave him made Paul feel more releaved about himself. It made him feel like he wasn't the only one who was having trouble. For example, in paragraph 45 it says, the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. It gave him feel that even if he doesnt suceed in school, it doesn't mean he won't be able to suceed in anything else.
22423	8	Throughout the story Gifts, Mr. Leonard and Paul have a lot of the same background. When Mr. Leonard was growing up they did not have learning centers that could help him. He also could not read as well, just like Paul.      When Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, because they did not want someone who could not read, he did not want Paul to be the same way. So, If Paul could go to the learning center and practice track and field, it would help him to know that he can accomplish anything if he wants to.
22424	8	paul is a kid that is very fast and has a chance to go to collage and do track. he just has to learn to read.
22425	8	Paul is confused by the information and has questions that he wants answered by Mr. Leonard. Also, after he learns about what he found Paul is empathetic and wants to help Mr. Leonard
22426	8	The information about Mr. Leonard being an amazing track athlete inspired Paul to work hard. When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out of college, it most likely motivated Paul to try his best not only on the track, but in school as well.
22427	8	The backround information had great impact on Paul. Paul was a student that was never picked for sports and also couldnt read. When Mr. Leonard realized that he was like him, he started to spend time with him. At first Paul had no idea who he was. Then one day after school he found out some information on Mr. Leonard, from the Track Coach. Once Paul realized that Mr. Leonard is just like him, Paul wanted to and believed that he could be a Track star, as well as be successful in life. The two spent time together on the Track and then Paul decided to spend some time with Mr. Leonard and teach him how to read. Getting the background information had a huge impact on Paul, because now these two are best friends.
22428	8	When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's inability to read he feels more like him. They're similarity brings them closer together and makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
22429	8	I think it was a good thing that Paul and Mr. Leonard met each other. Mr. Leonard and Paul have been through the same things. 'I knew them all, feeling of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' I think that Mr. Leonard is a good role model on Paul.
22430	8	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star and he wonders what happened to make him stop doing track. He asks Mr. Leonard about his reasons for quitting. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was 'a good athlete...but not a good student' (Gifts, 42). When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read, he tells Mr. Leonard that 'it's time to start [his] training' (Gifts, 46). This foreshadows that Paul will teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
22431	8	Mr. Leonard motivated Paul and taught him he could succeed if he tried to learn and want to succeed in school and life and not just to look at his athletics.
22432	8	When he found out about Mr. Leonard, he began to question why he didn't continue to further his career in track. And he was, in my opinion, curious as to why Mr. Leonard has him following in his steps.
22433	8	Paul doesnt understand what had happened untell Mr. Leonard explained it to him. It bothers him that the guy cant read and he flunked out so he decidese to held him learn how to read. Paul says 'that man had given his time to make.' So its like he is saying since he helped him he is going to teach him something.
22434	8	Paul was effected by the information because he did not know why he was being helped by Mr. Leonard. Finding the information out allowed Paul to understand more what he was doing and why he was doing it. Also, confronting Mr. Leonard about his past showed that he had seen the potential in Paul and wanted him to be trained and as good as he was, but actually able to do something with it.
22435	8	Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he is able to train and get better at hurdles, Mr. Leonard will be able to train and get better at reading. Paul is inspired to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to jump hurdles. Their common obstacle (difficulty reading) gives them a connection that seems to stregthen their relationship.
22436	8	This makes Paul feel like he has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard, but Paul also feels bad for Mr. Leonard and a little guilty, because Mr. Leonard has been helping Paul for weeks and had recieved nothing in return.  Paul then decides that he should help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22437	8	The information that Paul discovers makes him want to help Mr. Leonard. The story implies that Paul is taking Mr. Leonard back to the school/learning center so he can teach him how to read. He was empathetic in the way Mr. Leonard was when Paul told him on his way to the learning center the first day that he could not read.
22438	8	It shows that he wants somebody like himself to go after so things he wasent able to accomplish.
22439	8	I knew Paul was a good athlete but he wasn't a good student. He was going to college and he had alot of tutors that helped him to get through high school.
22440	8	The information about Mr. Leonard is similar to Paul. Mr. Leonard could not read and when he learned from Paul that he could not read either so he had to go to the learning center and had only homework and nothing else to do after school Mr. Leonard helped Paul find something to do after school.
22441	8	It pushes the hurdler to do well, in school and on the track. The narrator realizes that Mr.Leonard can not read because he askes for his name at the track. But Mr. Leonard went to college and became something of himself. And that inspiors the narratior.
22442	8	Well when Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he is amazed.  Saying how good you were, breaking records.  Yet, when Paul asked why did you quit running. Leonard said he didn't quit but, flunked out of college.  Which Paul suddenly relizes, he needs to keep good grades, to keep jumping hurdles in track.
22443	8	I think Mr. Leonard's story has effected Paul in a way that he can relate to. You can tell this in paragraph 45 line 1 and 2 he says 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I them well- feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'
22444	8	Paul is suprised at this information. He confronted Mr. Leonard about it and found out about Mr. Leonard's reading disability. He felt understanding towards the feelings of embarrassment that Mr. Leonard had. The information also helps Paul to see that he can help Mr. Leonard excel in something as well.
22445	8	Paul finds out that mr. leonards can't read. he realizes how important schooling is also and how it can be challenging. Once he sees how his coach cant read he'll see how he need to try just has hard in school.
22446	8	The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is embrassement. He felt embrassed because he feels embrassed when he is  asked to read aloud in class.
22447	8	Paul feels better about himself after he finds out Mr. Leonard can not read. Paul wishes to help Mr. Leonard to learn by learning together. It shows that Paul has gained confidence.
22448	8	The back round information that he got on Paul had a sad effect on Paul because he was unable to read what they had written him because he was a good athlete but not a very good student so he was not able to read because he never learned, when the kid tells the coach that he's goin to the Learning Center to get help with reading the kid realize that he can help the coach learn how to read.
22449	8	The effect that the background information has on on Paul is that he is motivated to excel not only in school, but in sports also.  He does not want to end up like Mr. Leonard and be a great athlete, but flunk out of school.  He wants to make Mr. Leonard proud by doing good in sports and in school.
22450	8	The effect that the background information that Paul had gained about Mr. Leonard made Paul feel like he wasn't the only person who had gone through poor reading and lack of athelitc skill. It was a motivition for Paul to do better in school and keep going into track.
22451	8	Mr. Leonard put the effect on Paul, like as a father-figure and made him feel better in everything he would do or want to do. Like teaching how to read better, or getting him into sports.
22452	8	The narrator Paul is confused when he he sees the URL page discovers that Mr.Leonard used to break records as a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul is questioned in his head that how could someone this good at sports be a hall monitor? Paul prints the paper off showing to Mr.Leonard the next day awaiting an explanation. Mr.Leonard says to Paul he flunke dout of college because he couldnt read and the work was jus to hard. The response motivates Paul and wants to help Mr.Leonard read.
22453	8	The information Paul had recieved on Mr. Leonard refclected on  Paul, because he felt a connection between the two of them. Paul felt as if they were in the same barrier at a point of time and he can overcome his obstacles
22454	8	Paul becomes empathetic toward Mr. Leonard. He knows the shame and embarrassment that Mr. Leonard must have felt. He remember what it felt like to be called upon to read aloud to the class and not be able to. He wants to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard had helped him.
22455	8	When he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college runner and that he dropped out because he couldn't read Paul understood what he was feeling. Paul felt lke he could help Mr. Leonard since he had helped Paul with track.
22456	8	In this story, Mr. Leonard invites paul to an after school event.  In which paul didnt find to interesting.  But one day Paul was told to look up something, which shared info and things about Mr. leonard's past.       After hearing that Leonard flunked out of school, because he never learned how to read. I think it kind of upset paul in a way.  Because Mr. Leonard reached out and taught paul how to run track.       So Paul feels it;s only fair he returns the deed, and helps him out.  Which i think is a really good thing. I'm sure he would've went far in school if he knew how to read.
22457	8	The background information has a big effect on Paul. He knows that he is embarrassed to read in front of the class. He knows Mr. Leonard felt the same way. Paul knows exactly how Mr. Leonard felt when he was younger. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out. That is why Paul tells Mr. Leonard that it is time to start his training.
22458	8	Paul wants to do track now and he also wants to help Mr. Leonard out because he didn't get to graduate college. So as they walk back to the school Paul says, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard.' It's time to start your training'.
22459	8	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background, at first he is very impressed. Hearing of Mr. Leonard success makes Paul realize how lucky he was to be getting help from a very successful hurdler. Once he learns of Mr. Leonard's reading problem, he is still very impressed with his physical skill, but comes to understand him in a new way. Paul also has trouble with reading, so he feels more connected to Mr. Leonard through their mutal love of track and their sharedd reading problems. Paul is so grateful for the help that Mr. Leonard gave him in track that he decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
22460	8	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star who had troubles in school, he feels that they have a similar problem. Paul says Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. Paul says this because he knows how it feels to not be able to read very well and how embarassing it is.
22461	8	Paul was supprised that Mr. Leonard was a track star and never told him about it.
22462	8	Backgroung on Paul is a lot like Mr. Leonard because Paul cant read and very good at hurdles. They had the same trubles.
22463	8	The effect the background information has on Paul, is that he is suprised. Paul didn't know any of that until the track coach told him to go to a website and look up Leonard. In a way it made Paul happy that they both had something in common, which made Paul want to help Leonard, like Leonard did for him.
22464	8	Paul was proud that he had been training with one of the best that there is. He is overjoyed at the fact that he is now doing well and has learned from a good person. Paul is also proud that he now has a spot on the track team when he used to be very unathletic.
22465	8	Paul met Mr. Leonard at the start of middle school and became friends by Mr. Leonard being Paul's mentor. And Paul commiting himself to Mr. Leonard to work 110% everyday for track and field. Before all of that mr. leonard was just a hall monitor.
22466	8	At the beggining of the story, Paul has no clue about Mr. Leonard's past. Once he finds out that he was a track star he feels compelled to find out more directly from Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard tells him the story of how he flunked out of college Paul realizes it is time to give back to Mr. Leonard for what he has done for Paul, so Paul said 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard it's time to start your training.' This shows that Paul is going to help him read as a way to show thanks to Mr. Leonard for teaching him to run.
22467	8	It has a great deal of affect on him because he knows that the teacher is just like him. They both have issues with reading but their also both good at a sport.
22468	8	Paul is told by Mr. Leonard that when he was in high school he had all the same issues that he was going through. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out of college and how he was a track runner. This effected Paul because he could relate to Mr. Leonard in so many ways. At the end Paul feels he has a responsibiltiy to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read, as Mr. Leonard taught him how to jump hurdles.
22469	8	It also has effect on Paul when there's background information about Mr. Leonard.
22470	8	The information gives Paul a certain motivation because, he and Mr. Leonard have to get over the same obsticles in life. He also finds out that Mr. Leonard was a very good runner even though he had reading problems, so Paul knows he can over come the same obsticles.
22471	8	He sits there and  mutters and studders alot and has a problem of reading like some people do.
22472	8	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard makes Paul look up to him becasue he used to be a track runner also and even broke records. The background information also encouraged Paul to ask further questions about Mr. Leonard to himself.
22473	8	He felt the emotions  in his words. He new them all to well he can't read  like Mr. Leonard so when paul would read in front of the class he would feel the embarrassment  because the lack of reading. So he feels that he can help him read as well.
22474	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard gives Paul some motivation because he is in the same position where Mr. Leonard was when he was a runner.  Mr. Leonard tells Paul about how he was a good runner, but he could'nt read so all of that was taken away from him.  It gives Paul motivation to keep trying to read so he can run in college.  Paul describes how he understands how Mr. Leonard feels and that he understands.  Mr. Leonard helps Paul actually excel in something.
22475	8	In paragraph 38 the narrator knows that Mr.Leonard won the 400 meter hurdle at the nationals as a freshman in college. The narrator realizes this and wants to become a greater athlete just like Mr. Leonard even though he was a poor reader similar to the narrator's situation.
22476	8	The background that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard effects him because he realizes now that you can do anything that you put your mind to and not everyone can do everything.An example from the story is when Mr. Leonard asked Paul what his name was so right there you figured out that Mr. Leonard didn't know how to read as well.
22477	8	The information Paul got was important because it told him about Mr. Leonard and his past. He was a college hurdler and broke records and got a scholorship. But, then he knew he couldn't read and college was hard. The tutors weren't enough and he eventually flunked out of college.     This helps Paul because he can't read either but that didn't stop Mr. Leonard from chasing his dream. So he will teach Paul to hurdle and that will show him that he can overcome any obstacle in his way. Paul had never done hurdles before, so this can tell Paul that he can learn to read if he practices and takes time at it.
22478	8	During the story Paul gets stoppedd in the hall by Mr. Leonard. He was going to the learning center when Mr.Leonard asked him where he was heading to. Then, Paul told him to the learning center. Mr.leonard questiong him why he was heading to the learning center. Paul answered him why because he couldn't read. The next day Paul was going to head to the learning center when Mr.leonard told him to go to the gym with him. Paul was sort of confused to why he was doing this. Then, he took him outside to the track field. He told him to do a hurdled. Paul thought he was horrible on doing it . So then, Mr Leonard told him he needed to make an effort. One day a trainer asked him how he get so fast. Paul then answered him that because of Mr. Leonard. The coached smiled and gave him a scrap of paper with and URL. Then, Paul went to tell his coach. Soon enough Paul found out that it was his coach that was an good athlete but, found out he couldn't read. He was a good athlete but, the college board didn't accept him because of his reading levels. Paul then decided to train the coach.The effect is that Paul was learning how to read and he was going show Mr.Leonard. It's only amount of time to put a effort to it.
22479	8	Mr. Leonard's background information effected Paul because it is exactly what Paul is going through in his life. In paragraph 42, Mr. Leonard told the story about how he was a good athlete, but not a good student. Feelings of embarrassment were with both of them because they couldnt read.
22480	8	He is upset that Mr. Leonard never told him about his past of being a track star, but he keeps going on and training with Mr. Leonard.
22481	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard inspires Paul to work hard and help Mr. Leonard in return for helping Paul. Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals but he flunked out of college. The information also helps Paul understand Mr. Leonard better, and he can relate more to him now. They both had the feeling of embarassment, because Mr. Leonard lost his scholarship since he wasn't a good student and flunked out of college. Paul was embarassed because he couldn't read.
22482	8	I think it gave paul more confidence, because of the fact tha he was able to get help with school and do a sport that he loves which is track and field.
22483	8	Paul is now an excellent runner thanks to all of Mr. Loenard's training and motivation.  Paul is greatly effected by the knowledge of his background because now he can understand how important it is for him to learn how to read.  If Paul wants to go to college, he may get a scholorship for running, but it will not do him any good unless he can read and pass his classes.  The information has motivated Paul to try his hardest and school and to learn how to read.
22484	8	Paul finds out that Mr.Leonard was a track star in college. He won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records. But that was all he did while in college because he flunked out. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Paul knew how emabarassed Mr.Leonard was, like how Paul gets embarassed when he is called to read out loud or when he doesn't know and answer. Paul then realizes that he can help Mr.Leonard with his reading.
22485	8	The background info about Mr. Lenard makes Paul want to be the best because he knows what it takes to be the best.
22486	8	This story is about a child who is in school and there is a hall monitor, whom always tells other kids to 'Move along, people, move along!' This child has no knowledge of who this man is.      In the beginning of the story they are just two normal people trying to do their own job such as, Paul getting to class and doing his homework and Mr. Leonard doing his job as a hall monitor. Soon after Mr. Leonard stops Paul in the hall one day he shows Paul something that Paul has never done before and didn't know exactly what the symbol of a hurdle is.      Paul soon then finds out that Mr. Leonard Grabowski is the track and field coach for the school Paul had attended. Paul then tries hard to achieve the goal of jumping the hurdle. He also makes it to where he understands the symbol of the hurdle and jumping over it. The symbol of the hurdle is to take anything life throws at you and make the best of it.
22487	8	When the reader gtets a backround informations about Mr. Leonard, there was an effect that the backround information has on Paul. That effect would be that Paul must think that he is a good runner and that he can do anything.
22488	8	The background information that Paul recieves has a great effect on him.  In the beginning of thr passage, Paul believes that he is just 'one of a select few' and that he is kindof alone in his journey through middle school.  By gaining this background information on Mr. Leonard, Paul feels that he can relate to him and feels like he has made a friend and gained a mentor.
22489	8	The background information has on Paul was that he couldn't read, and he had to go to some thing called Learning Center to help him read, and with school work. So pretty much they just help him with the homework, and to know how to read.
22490	8	During the story information about Mr. Leonard previously being an athlete is revealed, this effects Paul by helping him appreciate what Mr. Leonard has done for him. It goes on to allow Paul and Mr. Leonard to share empathy for eachother, as they both struggled reading and suffered with the embarrassment of that.
22491	8	Its makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard flunked out of college. Also Paul is greatful to have someone with such expirence helping him in track.
22492	8	Paul is disappointed that Mr. Leonard did not tell him who he really was. But when Mr. Leonard explained everything that had happened to him Paul felt sorry for him and wanted to help him learn to read.
22493	8	The background information that the narrator recieves  relates to Mr. Leonard's impressive track record, flunking out of college, and inabillity to read. Paul is, at first, shocked to hear about Mr. Leonard's skills and record, as shown in paragraphs thirty-five and thirty-eight. Paul is secondly inspired to help Mr. Leonard learn to read, as Mr. Leonard helped Paul excell in track. Paul's urge to help Mr. Leonard learn this skill relates directly to the revelation of the background information; as Paul put it in paragraph forty-five, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
22494	8	Paul related better to Mr.Leonard once he found out more about him. He most related to the fact that Mr.Leonard was not a good reader either.
22495	8	During the story, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a talented track athlete in college. However, Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard was not a good student, which makes Paul feel more kinship between himself and Mr. Leonard. This feeling of kinship motivates Paul to not only keep working hard during track, but also to work hard on his studies. Paul also uses this new information to find a way he can repay Mr. Leonard for all of his help, by teaching him to read.
22496	8	When Paul found the information on Mr.Leonard about him being a track star he though he could do it. But he asked him about it and they both have the same problem they could not read and struggled on work. So Mr. Leonard wanted to try and help Paul find a sport he was good at and possible help him be something like he was. So they are like the same people and have/had the same problem so he wanted to help as much as he could.
22497	8	Well I feel that after Paul heard about Mr. Leonard's story and background he becomes much more interested in track and in Mr. Leonard. I think he might feel sorry for Mr. Leonard. Paul tells Mr. Leonard to walk back towards the school and says 'It's time to start your training.'
22498	8	It gives Paul a reason to get better at reading so he can continue at what he's good at. Mr. Leonard my have broken the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman in college and he had a scholarship but he lost it because he's grade were bad and he didn't go to any for help. He is trying to make sure that it doesn't happen to Paul.
22499	8	Paul feels more motivated to do well because he doesnt want to end up like the janitor. He wants to be able read so he isnt a grown man that cant read. He said he knew the emotions of Mr.Leonard to well.
22500	8	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is somewhat strange but the same. In the story Pual doesn't know how to read, and back in the day Mr. Leonard didn't know how to read and still doesn't, thats why he says on the track field 'What is your name son?' and has been looking at Paul's pass two days a week. It seems like Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul succeed in track while he is also learning to read. At the end of the story Pual is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so he can finish his dreams and so on.
22501	8	He acctes sprised that he did not tell him that he was a track alstar. He waonder why he did not tell him about it and when he found out why he didn't tell him. He knew what he had gone through he was going though the same thing.
22502	8	Paul is shocked, sad, and mabey a little upset about what he learned from the internet. ''Why didn't you tel' me about this?' I pressed.' This shows that Paul had a hard time understanding what he had found. He did not know what to think about Mr.Leonard and he wanted an explination about what had happened. ' This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly i realized what i could do for him' Paul feels sorry and sad for Mr.Leonard and he wants to help him. Paul was helped at excelling at something and now he wanted to pay him back.
22503	8	He was affected with the infomation with shock.'well, what happened after that?'
22504	8	The background information gives Paul courage and understanding. Both Paul and Mr. Leonard have difficultly reading. Paul obtains help at the learning center, but Mr. Leonard did not when he was in school. Mr. Leonard helps Paul jump hurdles for track. After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's secret he offers to help Mr. Leonard learn to read too.
22505	8	Once Paul learns Mr. Leonard's background, he connects with him on the basis that they both have had a struggle with reading. Paul recalls the feeling of embarrassment he experiences when asked to read in class because he feels Mr. Leonard has had to face problems because of his reading ability also. Paul finally decides to repay Mr. Leonard's generosity and assist him in reading as Mr. Leonard has assisted him with track.
22506	8	When Paul learns of Mr.Leonards past achievements as a hurdler he is more dedicated to hurdling. also when Paul learns of his inability to read that caused him to not be able to run anymore, paul is more divoted to his studies.
22507	8	Paul is kind of suprised but knows how Mr. Leonard had to feel about not being able to read so he is going to help him train himself.
22508	8	Paul felt confused as to why Mr. Leonard never told him that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals as a college freshman.After Mr. Leonard told Paul the reasons why he never spoke about it, Paul connected completely. He knew how Mr. Leonard felt because he understood the feeling of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or when he didn't know the answer to a question. He then stated that Mr. Leonard had helped him excel at something, and that he would help Mr. Leonard with something as well.
22509	8	The information that Paul has on Mr. Leonard will help him to succeed in school and in track. For example, he trained with Mr. Leonard and that helped him to become a better runner, later in the story he found out that Mr. Leonard was the best track runner when he was in school. Finally, Paul discovered that Mr. Leonard had actually flunked out of college and because of this Paul will want to work harder in school so that he can still run.
22510	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard's inability to read made Paul feel closer to him. Paul had trouble reading as well, and Mr. Leonard has helped Paul excel at running. Paul was encouraged through Mr. Leonard's success as an athlete.
22511	8	Mr. Leonard has a very huge effect on Paul throughout this story. As in the Mr. Leonard use to not be able to read and was a very good athlete who broke records and everything, but he flunked out of college due to he could not read. As for Paul he is going threw the same thing he can not read and Mr. Leonard is going to help him by coaching him in track and going to college. This is how they both are alike in this story about their lives.
22512	8	At first Paul shocked that Mr. Leonard had done something like that and he wondered why he let it go. However Mr. Leonard didnt want to leave, he like Paul could not read very well and he flunked out of collage. Paul soon understood that Mr. Loenard didnt tell him because he was ashamed that he couldnt read and that he had flunked. Paul then decides to pay the favor back and he helps Mr. Leonard read.
22513	8	By learning that Mr. Leonard also has trouble with reading, Paul finds it easy to relate to him. This information also helps prove to Paul that even though there are struggles in life, you just have to work hard and you'll find your niche and succeed.
22514	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard's failure in collage makes Paul look at his own obsticles. Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels and clearly states that in the text. He said he knew what it felt like to feel embarrassed. Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard, like he had helped him. He says 'C'mon Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training'
22515	8	I think that Paul understands why Mr. Leonard asked him to meet him at the track. I also think that when the Paul learns that Mr. Leonard can not read, he knows why he didn't know his name. Paul also knows a way to help Mr. Leonard. Paul takes him to the basement to the learning center.
22516	8	The background information on Mr. Leonard effected Paul because he has problem with reading too. Paul thought he couldn't do much because he couldn't read. He was embarassed just like Mr. Leonard was f his past. Mr. Leonard had a scholarship he last because he couldn't read.
22517	8	I have diacuvrde that Mr. Loenard was a track star and he reads poorly. And Paul was not good at sports.
22518	8	The background informations has a huge effect on Paul. At first Paul is astonished how good of a hurdler Mr.Leonard was. The narrator states,'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This shows his interest and also his concern he had on what happened after that. Then Paul felt very close to Mr.Leonard after he had told him about his reading trouble and failing college. This connected to Paul and Mr. Leonard wants him to succeed in both obstacle he is 'Hurdling'.
22519	8	He basicly know his whole life and where he came from and Where he lived
22520	8	During the story, Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. This effects Paul in certain ways. For example, in paragraph 45, Paul says that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too fimiliar to me. I knew them well...' He then goes on to say that the same thing is happening to Paul as well. He knew how Mr. Leonard feels.
22521	8	The information effects Paul in a way that makes Paul more interested in Mr. Leonard. It makes Paul ask questions about him, and now Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22522	8	The back ground information on Paul is less show its shows that he has not much of anything besides he cant read  but that he is a good sportts man and can do anthing he wants and go for his high gaoals.
22523	8	The background information that Paul receives puzzles him.  He doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard stopped racing when he was so good at it.  When Mr. Leonard informs Paul that he wasn't able to read and flunked out of college, that motivated Paul to learn and achieve as much as he possibly could.
22524	8	The background Paul gets on Mr. Leonard effects him in the way that it shows him that he needs to work hard, both athletically and academically, because sometimes your athletic career depends on your grades as well.
22525	8	It has effect on him beacuse he wasn't honest from the beginning. Paul just thought he was some man tryin to help for fun. Paul is wanting to play sports but just need's to find out about his coach. Or how his trainer is gonna react around his life.
22526	8	It shocks paul that Mr. Leonard has  won 400 meter hurdles in high school but, he did not graduate and he flunked out. He feels that he can do better.
22527	8	Paul finds out that Mr.Leonard was a track star from the website the coach gave him but then found out Mr.Leonard didnt know how to read.
22528	8	Paul feels some what hurt due to the fact that Mr.Leonard didn't tell Paul about his success as a college hurdler. You can tell Paul is hurt when he asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'
22529	8	Paul understands how Mr. Leonard feels, because he knows the embarrassment when he is called to read out loud in front of the class. Paul wants Mr. Leonard to start trainin again.
22530	8	It makes Paul feel like he needs to give something back. He knew how to relate to Mr. Leonard. He thought that since he had helped him that he can give something back.
22531	8	The track and field coach gives Paul a URL to get background information about Mr. Leonard. Paul feels that Mr. Leonard and him can relate to one another due to Mr. Leonard's past. Paul confronts Mr. Leonard and has him explain to him what had happened. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard's past since he is dealing with the present issues.
22532	8	Paul was shocked to see mr. Leonard was a great track star in college. And didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him.
22533	8	The effect it has on Paul is that Paul tries to do good in jumping hurdles now, and thats because he had Mr. Leonard help him with it, and Mr. Leonard was a collage athlete.
22534	8	The information that shows that Mr. Leonard wsa a very good athlete back in his time and went to be a great one, but he could not read.  With Mr. Leonard's depressing story, it made Paul realzie that he is a great runner like Mr. Leonard but he cannot read like Mr. Leonard did.  It shows Paul he needs to learn how to read so a college will accept him and let him run for their teams because he can read.
22535	8	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard he relates to the story. Paul understands that reading is important and you have to work hard. Paul did not want to end up like Mr. Leonard and dropping out of college because he could not read. Paul understood Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarrasment by not knowing an answer or to read out loud. Paul notices Mr. Leonard gave up his time to help him excel at something.
22536	8	When paul first experiences what Mr.Leonard done in High school he finds that awesome that there is someone else out there just like himself.
22537	8	He was appoled about what he read. He thought that maybe if he (Paul) tried a little harder and kept everything up, and did what he was suppose to do then he might just make it where Mr. Leonard was. And could possably help Mr. Leonard get back there. And help him make a brighter future.
22538	8	Paul realizes why Mr.Leonard was so curious about the Learning Center and took an interest in helping him.  I think this made Paul feel better, knowing that someone could relate to his reading problem and help him.
22539	8	'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' Within these words, Paul gives an indication of his feelings. He is motivated by the fact that he is being trained by a man, Mr. Leonard, who, in his past, broke many track records. However, Paul is also inspired by Mr. Leonard's story. Because Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, he was ripped away from his passion: running track. This encourges Paul to work harder to excel in school when all he finds comfort in is hiding when he is overwhelmed by all the things he feels he is not successful at. Overall, the effect of Mr. Leonard's background is a positive influence, and it reaches out to push Paul harder in his endless battle in reading.
22540	8	Paul is very suprised that Mr. Leonard broke records for track when he was a freshman and Paul also feels bad for him because he cant read. Paul knows what its like to not be able to read because he cant read either so Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard learn how.
22541	8	because paul few in the remedical reading program 2 times
22542	8	When Paul finds out who Mr. Leonard he wondered why he stopped when he was a record breaking track runner. He is also very impressed and humbled that Mr. Leonard would actually tutor him in track, considering he was one of the worst athletes.
22543	8	Paul probably thinks in the begining of the story that Mr. Leonard is just a bossy grump. In the end Paul's views of Mr. Leonard change because of the website Paul looks up. Paul now seems to be happy for Mr. Leonard about winning nationals at college for the hurdle race and willing to help him with his reading problem.
22544	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a good impact on Paul. Paul notices that Mr. Leonard lived a life similar to his since he could not read well. He also learns how Mr. Leonard was able to teach him so well because he was once a track star. Mr. Leonard had broken records for the 400 meter hurdles. He introduced hurdles to Paul so that he may have a reason to continue to work hard at school. It shows Paul that he can still do something that he enjoys, as long as he continues to work hard.
22545	8	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that since Mr. Leonard helped him with running and Mr. Leonard couldn't read, Paul felt like he could do a favor like Mr. Leonard did for him and teach him how to read.
22546	8	The background information gives Paul the encouragement to work harder towards his goals.  After finding out who Mr. Leonard really was, Paul decided that he could not fail one who he looked up to.  After finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, Paul decided that he should work on his school work despite what athletics play a role in his life.
22547	8	The information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard inspires him to help Mr. Leonard in the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him. When Mr. Leonard explained to Paul that he could not read and flunked out of college Paul felt a very strong connection because he was not a very good reader himself. Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had given up his time to help Paul and that Paul could also give up his time to help Mr. Leonard.
22548	8	When Paul sees the background information about Mr. Loenard and how he was a great track runner he is very curious. Once he hears Mr. Leonard's story about flunking college he realizes they are alike. They both struggle at school but enjoy track. Paul said that he knew the feelings of embarrassment well. He feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard appreciates what he did for him and he wants to help him. At the end he rea;izes what he could do to help Mr. Leonard and starts right away.
22549	8	After Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, the effect on him was most likely because of the resemblence of Mr. Leonard's past and Paul's life now. ''I was a good athlete,' he said softly, 'but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even thent he work was always too hard.'' Mr.Leonard was in the same position Paul was in except he had no tutor to help him. This made Paul feel like someone understood what he was going through. 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him,' Knowing that Mr. Leonard can't read, after getting to know Mr. Leonard's background, Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22550	8	The background information effects paul by showing him that he is not the only one out there that cannot read it also provides that you need your education skills in life to be succeful.
22551	8	In the stroy the background information the paul found on Mr. Leonard took an effect on paul because he couldnt read himself. He felt bad for him and took him to the learning center.
22552	8	It informs him that not only himself but Mr. Leonard also has a problem with reading too. He felt clamed when he found out that a runner of such skill has the same problem as himselve.
22553	8	When Paul finds out that he is not the only one who has trouble with reading he feels more comfortable. He wants to be accepted and not to be the weird, dumb kid. It also makes him feel very special that someone took time out of their day to work with him at something and to help him excel at something he might not have otherwise been good at. He felt he needed to repay the man. So at the end he decides to teach him to read.
22554	8	That the coach wasnt good at reading, but he had made it to college though with people tutoring him, but it was different back in his day. And he wants to prove to paul that he has a special gift and should know what kind of gift it is. But in the story the coach says that he had to relie on his freinds to help him and get a tutor when he had gone to college. And that paul is doing the same thing he's relieing on people to help him.
22555	8	The background information given to Paul in the story from the coach helps him in showing that no matter how good you are at something, you are not really wanted without an education which gives Paul motivation to aim for success in school.
22556	8	After Paul found the information on Mr. Leonard, he seemed confused. He wondered why Mr. Leonard had not told him that the man was a track star in college. When Mr. Leonard slowly unravels the truth and his embarrassment about the matter, Paul starts to understand exponentially. Paul has issues with reading also, and he knows how Mr. Leonard felt. He says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This shows Paul's feelings of empathy for Mr. Leonard, and his personal knowledge of the trials people with reading troubles have.
22557	8	HE WANT THE GIFTS TO MEAN SOMETHING SO THATS WHY HE WRITER.
22558	8	The effect that it has on Paul is that he is the same way; he's good at track and feild but he can't read. Even though Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story, Paul doesn't not think any less of himself.
22559	8	Paul feels inspired by Mr. Leonard. Not only was Mr. Leonard a great runner like Paul, he also was unable to read like Paul.
22560	8	Once Paul figures all of this out, he wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
22561	8	Paul felt closer to Mr. Leonard. Naturally Paul was curious about Mr. Leonard's experience as a runner in track, but when found out why he stopped running things suddenly made sense to him.  Mr.Leonard saw himself in Paul , and now Paul knew it.
22562	8	Paul feels empathetic toward Mr. Leonard because he has the same problems Mr. Leonard has. Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard by helping him get back into shape and be able to be good in track and field again.
22563	8	Pual wanted to learn more about Mr.Leonard because he was interested in being on the track team. Paul wanted to get close to him so he would have a better chance at making in on the track team.       Paul started taking the reading classes so he could get more time with Mr.Leonard and get closer so when it came time for track he had a spot to run in track.
22564	8	Paul feels as if he can relate to Mr. Leonard's feelings and past struggles. This is shown when the author says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well---'. Paul is then motivated to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard has helped him; 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard...It's time to starting your training.'
22565	8	Having the knowledge that Mr. Leonard was once a National Champion In athletic event yet, couldnt manage to meet the educational requirments gave paul a connection to Mr. leonard
22566	8	He is surprised at what he finds and is confused about why this was kept from him. It transformed Paul because suddenly he knew that he was not alone. Paul was empathetic just like Mr. Leanord when Paul was going to his remedial reading class. 'The emotions in Mr. Leanord's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well...This man had given his time to help me excel at something.'
22567	8	This background information makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard dropped out of college and stopped running.  He also feels bad for Mr. Leonard for having to drop out of college.
22568	8	During the story Paul gets asked to be on the High School Track Team. The coach was curious as to how he had gotten so fast. The coach instantly knew that he had been training with Mr. Leonard. After he was told to look up the former track star, he soon found out that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading  too. This helped him be motivated to do well in school and work hard in track competitions because he isn't the only one who had those kind of problems.
22569	8	In the story, Paul and Mr. Leonard start talking about Mr. Leonard's past. Paul then learns that Mr. Leonard was an excellent athelete, affiliated with track and feild, and broke records for it. This is confirmed with a sentence that Paul says to Mr. Leonard, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'. Later on though, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college.
22570	8	The background of Mr.Leonard was the same problem that paul was going threw.
22571	8	The effect the background information has on Paul is that Paul wants to keep doing track, but he also wants to keep his grades up. Paul goes to the Learning Center to get help with his reading, and when Mr. Leonard stoped him in the hall way and asked for him to start training, Paul was shocked. Paul was even more shocked when he found out that Mr. Leonard lost his scholarship and flunked out, that encouraged Paul to keep going to the Learning Center and keep doing track.
22572	8	The effect it has on Paul was sort of major because Paul can really feel he relates to Mr. Leonard. I feel that Paul really looks up to him now after finding out that even though you can be an amazing athlete reading will effect you in the long run. In this little story Mr. Leonard baasically says that nobody wants a dumb athlete.
22573	8	The background information was a shock to Paul because he didn't think that Mr. Leonard was a college track star.  The reasons for this is that after he found out about Mr. Leonard, Paul ask at school about his college track records even though he had a paper on the Internet about him.  That is why Paul was shock that Mr. Leonard was a college track star.
22574	8	Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to Paul, and Mr. Leonard didnt go to college.
22575	8	The background details that the reader gets about Mr. Leonard have many effects on Paul.  When Mr. Leornard told Paul he was a good athlete but did not know how to read, Paul felt as though the feelings were too familiar.  Paul remembered how he felt embarrassed when he was called to read aloud, and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read, just how Mr. Leornard taught him how to run.
22576	8	The background infomation shows Paul that if you just work hard then you can do anything you want. Like Mr.Leonard had to work hard to win the 400 meter race. He is still helping people work hard to better them selfs.
22577	8	The information has a good effect on Paul. It shows him that Mr. Leonard wants him to be good at school and have fun in sports. Even though Mr. Leonard couldn't read he want Paul to. After realizing that Mr. Leonard gave him so much , he wanted to give something back in return.
22578	8	Paul gathers information on how Mr. Leonard was a great student athlete, that he was not a good student and that he could not read.  Paul feels like he has a connection to Mr. Leonard. Paul cannot read very well either, he has to go to remedial classes for it. Mr. Leonard, was a great track star. Paul wants to be a great track star like him.           Paul feels like Mr. Leonard and him could become friends sometime in the future given their similar circumstances. When a reader would read this, they might find these similarities to be true as well.
22579	8	'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his past and the challenges of trying to get by without knowing how to read Paul's own feelings of embarrssment broke through. Paul knew how it felt to not know the answers and to want to succeed but not having the tools to do so. He started to understand why Mr. Leonard would want to teach him to run, and encouraged him to practice with the team but also why he sofented when Paul told him he didn't know how to read. He felt that if Mr. Leonard could teach him to do something he know loved he should return the favor.
22580	8	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track hurdler in college and won a national title. Paul tells Mr. Leonard what he saw on the internet the previous night. Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past and Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was just like him in school. It made sense to Paul why Mr. Leonard is helping Paul with practicing track because Mr. Leonard was just like him in school and he didn't want to see Paul end up like him later in life.
22581	8	The effect that this background information has on Paul is that Paul can relate to it.  Paul related to Mr. Leonard's embarassment by recalling being embarassed when he was called upon in class and didn't know the answer.  It also made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard the way he had helped him.
22582	8	It surprises him but also gives him hope that he can be a good student and a good athlete.
22583	8	Finding out that you are being tought by a former National Champion in track and has broken records would be a huge confidence builder. But knowing the fact that he couldnt read as well im sure he felt closer to him after that and felt more open. But also knowing that he flunked out of college because not being able to read made him want to work harder and become better at what he does.
22584	8	Makes him wonder why he is living the way he is now, and what he did to destroy his athletic carrer.
22585	8	It makes him confused about Leonard.and more interested about  Leonard.
22586	8	The background information inspires Paul to practice harder at both track and reading. It also inspires Paul to help Mr. Leonard get better at reading.
22587	8	he was wondering why mr. leonard did not tell him that he was a track star in high school and then flunked out of college.
22588	8	The background information had an effect on me as a reader and made me think about the text more deeply. The article states 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This background information had a huge effect on Paul. It made him realize that he can accomplish a lot of things if you keep working hard.
22589	8	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard is a poor reader and its very good in learning stuff other then sports, but paul desides since mr lenard helped him learn his gonna teach him now.
22590	8	By Mr. Leonard, giving Paul background information, it made Paul want to help him as much as Mr. Leonard had helped Paul. So by Mr. Leonard beleiving in Paul, now Paul beleives in Mr. Leonard. Paul reminded Mr. Leonard of his childhood, and Mr. Leonard reminded Paul of how he's struggling now in school.
22591	8	it has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard helped him so much. now Paul will do much better.
22592	8	It has a good effect on Paul because it makes him want to run the hurdles and try to be good at track.
22593	8	The effect the background information of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is captivating. Paul is very intrested, curious and soon understanding of why Mr Leonard kept this secret from him. He is also motivated to teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to overcome being afraid of being picked last in sports.      'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This quote Paul said at the end of the story shows he's ready to help Mr. Leonard, because Mr. Leonard helped Paul.
22594	8	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard wants Paul to follow in his footsteps, But Mr. Leonard wants Paul to make it. I think Paul realizes he has potential to make it, especially with Mr. Leonards help.
22595	8	The effect on Paul was that he could'nt read, but he was a fast runner on the track field and the coach was pleased.
22596	8	The author said,' I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' That he had relied on his friends to help him with his work, because back then they didn't have no learning centers. Since he couldn't do his high school work by him self, he flunked out of college cause the work was way harder.      When Mr. Leonard said that it probly brought Paul down seeing how he is in a learning center getting a little help. Now Paul most likely think that since he isn't doing all his work by him self, that he's not going to be able to make it through college.
22597	8	When Paul did the background information eh was surprised that Mr.Leonard was an althele.  Paul said that he broke so many records when he was in college.  But then he found out by Mr.Leonard that he dropped out because of his grades.
22598	8	Mr. Leonard was very similar to Paul. He wasn't very good in school and didn't get the best grades and neither does Paul. Mr. Leonard didn't really know how to read and that's what Paul works on two days a week so obvioulsy Paul isn't very good at reading either.      So Mr. Leonard wanted something for this kid to do besides be picked last on a team all the time in P.E. or something and Mr. Leonard was a very talented track and field player so he met up with Paul at school around 2:30 one day and asked if the kid liked basketball or something and he didn't so Mr. Leonard asked Paul if he would be interested in track. So Paul did it and turned out to be really good. Then Paul comes to find out that Mr, Leonard didn't have very good grades in college either and that is what ruined Mr. Leonards college track and field carreer.
22599	8	Mr.Leonard and Paul backgrounds are very similar,they both are good at track and they both couldnt read that well.
22600	8	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard allows Paul to relate to him and to see that Mr. Leonard went through the same situation that Paul is going through. He shows this by saying, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' He realizes that Mr. Leonard understands what it is like and will be able to help him more effectively than another coach might be able to. Paul also learns that track and field might be his ticket to success to somewhat make up for his poor reading skills. All of this allows Paul and Mr. Leonard to form a strong bond because they are now able to help each other with their weaknesses and better themselves as people and it gives Paul the confidence he needs to continue.
22601	8	Paul goes to the website and realizes that Mr Leonard was a big track star. Paul then goes and asks Mr. Leonard what happend after high school with his track career. When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had to quit track because he failed out of college because he could not read, it gave Paul more confidence about the fact that he has trouble reading.
22602	8	Paul feels sorry for Mr.leonard. He says he knew he felt because he has the same problem and he knows what it's like to feel left out.
22603	8	Paul is impressed but concerned with the bacckground imformation he gathers about Mr. Leonard. Paul sounds impressed and reminds Mr. Leonard of being  '..a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.' But once Mr. Leonard tells paul of being a poor reader Paul seems concerned and asks what happend after doing so well. When Mr. Leonard imformed him of flunking out of college Paul offered him help. 'It's time to start your training.' is what he said to Mr. Leonard
22604	8	Paul relises that him and his coach have alot of things in common. the bothe have trouble in spelling and reading. They are both very into track.
22605	8	When Paul found out about Mr. Leonards past as a college track star he is amazed, but it wasnt till Mr. Leonard told him about how he flunked off the team because he couldn't that they really boned. Seeing how not being able to read had effected Mr. Leonards life drove paul to do the very best he could.
22606	8	When Paul hears about Mr. Leonard's past he immediatly feels like he can do whatever he would want. He feels this way because Mr. Leonard has the same problem he does and Mr. Leonard overcame his problem.
22607	8	The effect it had on Paul was good. It made Paul want to try harder and help Mr.Leonard out with his reading. Paul relized that if he could be in a sport and not be picked last in gym class then he could read. Paul learned that practice made him be able to hurdle and that if he practices with reading then he will be able to read.
22608	8	hes very shocked and now he does not know if he can trust him anymore.
22609	8	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that Paul is in the same position Mr. Leonard was in high school. Paul was working at being a better reading at school but also trying to find a place on a team. Mr. Leonard had a place on a team but blew off school. Mr. Leonard made sure that Paul stayed motivated to learn to read because Mr. Leonard never could, causing him to flunk out of college.
22610	8	Paul was effected greatly by the background information on Mr. Leonard because just like Paul Mr. Leonard had trouble reading too.  Both Mr. Leonard and Paul had the feeling of embarrasment when they were called upon to read in class.  Paul  thought that he could help Mr. Leonard overcome his obsticle of reading just like Mr.  Leonard had helped him overcome his. Paul didn't feel so bad after all because someone just like him had succeeded in life and accomplished something great.
22611	8	The background story help us to see the conection in between Paoul and Mr Leonard both have the same problems but in a different situation
22612	8	Paul didn't know that the school janitor was a former track player. After he found out about him flunking out of college because he couldn't read, he decided that he would make him happy and run track.
22613	8	The background information has a effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard information is related to Paul. Mr. Leonard couldn't read when he was in high school. Paul is in high school now and has problems with his reading. Mr. Leonard was on the track team in high school and now Paul is on the track team.
22614	8	The background information that Paul got from the URL the coach had scribbled down on a piece of scrap paper effected him dramaticaly. It made Paul realize that him and Mr. Leonard had something in common, they both couldn't read. It made Paul feel closer to Mr. Leonard because he knew exactly how Mr. Leonard had felt as a young adult. After all that overwhelming information he was just told, Paul said in the story, 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard excel at reading like Mr. Leonard had helped him excel at the hurdles.
22615	8	The effect of the backgroud information has on Paul changes the way he looks at Mr. Leonard. At first, Paul thought that Mr. Leonard was just being nice and helping him out. After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has the same problem as himself, it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard talks about his troubles in college all because of the fact that he can't read, Paul feels like he needs to help him and it he has empathy for him.
22616	8	At first, Paul is surprised and confused about why Mr. Leonard didn't say anything about his achievements as a track star in college.  After he asks Mr. Leonard about it, Paul realizes why he didn't say anything about his past records.  This softens Paul and allows him to see the real reason behind Mr. Leonard helping him become faster and a better runner.  In the end, Paul learns from Mr. Leonard and reaches out to him.  After seeing all that Mr. Leonard did for him, Paul decides he wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
22617	8	It connected with him and his struggles. Paul can't read and neither could Mr.Leonard at his age. I believe after learning about Mr.Leonards past than he will work hard at school, and try to achieve what Mr.Leonard couldn't.
22618	8	Paul getting the information on Mr. Leonard helps him see that greatness comes from within.
22619	8	The background infromation about Mr. Lenoard makes Paul curious. Paul wants to know why Mr. Lenard did not compete more. Paul is suprised to find that Mr. Lenoard has the same problem Paul does. Paul then sets out to help him with his reading, just as Mr. Lenoard helped him with hurdles.
22620	8	Hw finds out that the coach was a really good at sports but couldnt get the grades so when he went to colledge the coaches told him grades didnt matter so he stopped tiring then flunked out.
22621	8	Mr. leomard found out that paul use to be a big track runner and was really good at it.
22622	8	During the story, us readers gets background infromation about Mr. Leonard, because of the Coach giving Paul a URL to go too and when he asked Mr. Leonard about it later. What Mr. Leonard told Paul had a big effect on Paul because what he's going through now Mr. Leonard went through it in College. When Mr. Leonard was in college, it was hard for him to read and he was on a scholarship and he got kicked out because back then, they didn't care if you was an athlete and no other college wanted him. So he flunked out his Freshmen year. What Mr. Leonard was saying to Paul made him understand more, because unlike Mr. Leonard, Paul can go to the Learning Center and get help when needed.
22623	8	The effect of the background information has on paul is good. Mr. Leonard showed paul at the track he could get better at something if he tryed hard enough. At first he went through the hurdles slow, but the more he practiced the faster he got. He showed paul that if he practiced as hardas he did at the track towards reading. He could become a good reader.
22624	8	They both have problems so they gave Paul a gift knowing that he was a good runner. He wanted to make Paul feel better about himself. Mr G's story helped him relize his life.
22625	8	Paul didn't have any clue that Mr. Leonard was like that when he was younger. Paul didn't know that when he ran a backround check on him that he wouldn't find a track star, jock. He thought that he would find a nerd, book geek.
22626	8	During the beggining of the story the narrator dosen't really know Mr. Leonard but was they begin to talk at practice he begins to learn more about him.      In the story it says the narrator gets a URL to a website and it has information about Mr. Leonard on it. This gives the narrator information tat Mr. Leonard was a great athlete many years ago.      After talking with Mr. Leonard more he found out more information about him and why he didn't stay in school, he found out that he could't read.
22627	8	Paul finds out that Mr.Leonard was a great track star but didn't mention it to him and then he goes on to find out that Mr.Leonard went to college but lost his scholarship because he could not read.
22628	8	Mr. leonard is just like paul in different ways, that at first Mr. leoanard  does not realize at first that Paul can not read that well and that is why he has got to go down to the learning center and Mr. Leonard is not very good at reading only because when he was in college he had flunked out because back then there were no learning centers or even if you had to rely on your friends they didnt always help you or give you the right answers so Mr. Leonard may have been a good 400 meter hurdler but he wasnt so great in college and that is the same situation that paul is in.
22629	8	The effect that the background information has on Paul is shcoked.  According to 'Gifts,' 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment,' Paul never would have thought that Mr. Leanard and him were alike.
22630	8	Paul was shocked about it

'The college scouts told me, but college work is a lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called to read aloud or when I did'nt know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.
22636	8	the author supports paul by talking about him on the story he goes back and talks bout him
22637	8	The information about Mr. Leonard being a track and field star in college while not being able to read, just like Paul, changed Paul's outlook. Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was trying to push him to succeed. He wanted Paul's outcome to turn out better than his. Paul then decided to do Mr. Leonard a favor and help him. He started helping Mr. Leonard with his reading.
22638	8	He gets the background informatiom so that he knows a little bit about the person that he is training. So that they have someting to talk about when they start trainning.
22639	8	The background information tells about when Mr. Leonard was the best runner when he was in college. Paul, still didn't understand when Mr. Leonard told him that he couldn't read. Paul was having trouble with his reading too, but he wasn't the best runner out there like Mr. Leonard was, this was why he was confused when he was asked what his name was.
22640	8	If paul handn't had the background he does today then he wouldn;t be the coach he is today. He wouldn't have any motive to keep the kids going.
22641	8	That Mr. Leonard tells Paul about that he is going to the reading center help to learn but they had no learing center in the school he was bothered when he heard that.
22642	8	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard being a track star, it makes him curious about what had happened.  Mr. Leonard is trying to make Paul feel like he is something more than what he really feels.  Everyone around Paul makes him feel down.  Mr. Leonard shows faith in him.  He makes Paul realize he has more ability than he thought.  Paul never once thought he would be able to run fast, and be able to jump hurdles.Mr. Leonard helped show Paul what talents he really has, by pushing him.  Paul reminded Mr. Leonard as himself, that is all the encouragement he needed.
22643	8	The effect that the background information had on Paul was that he was so surpirsed that this college track star was now just a hall monitor. He was curious at why someone who was so good  at something doesnt do that thing anymore.
22644	8	Like Paul, Mr. Leonard couldn't read.
22645	8	We have learned Mr. Leonard used to be a good runner, but can't read. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he can not read. Paul also can not read. Paul realize that you have to be able to read to sucessed in life. Paul tries to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
22646	8	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, he feels more connected to him. Mr. Leonard couldn't read just like Paul can't read, but Mr. Leonard was an excellent athlete. This motivates Paul to work harder and try to accomplish what Mr. Leonard accomplished and more. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard now just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
22647	8	Paul relized that Mr. Leanard was just like him. 'The emotions in Mr. Leanard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.'
22648	8	It surprises Paul. Once Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read, it occured to Paul, that this sounds a little like his life. So Paul teaches Mr. Leonard how to read.
22649	8	I think that Paul needs help reading so that he could practice reading the words from a book. I think he could do that once he gets the chance to do it which I think is the best for him. He might also want to follow his dreams to become a coach one day for a team.
22650	8	When learning his background it reveals that he will have futurue problems from knowing all of these things everyone else doesn't.
22651	8	When he learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he wants to work hard like he did. He also wants to make Mr. Leonard proud. And he wants to help him learn how to read by tutoring him.
22652	8	The background information gives Paul a sense of hope and shows him what he could become if he keeps working hard. He also gains respect for Mr. Leonard because he was modest and humble and never mentioned it.
22653	8	He tries to get information on Mr. Leonard because, he doesn't really know him.
22654	8	The effect that the information had given Paul is that know he nows a little more about Mr. Leonard. When he shows Mr.Leonard the article he and Mr.Leonard discuss that Mr.Leonard also struggles with reading, they also are very good at track. Mr.Leonard is glad that there is a learning lab for kids to learn to read and he wishes there was one when he was a kid because then he could have made it through college.
22655	8	After Paul looks up the article and sees that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman and broke records. After seeing the article it seems like Paul was more motivated to run track hurdles and try to at least break a few records such as Mr. Leonard. Also after Mr. Leonard told his story to Paul on how he did in school, Paul also then wanted to help Mr. Leonard how to learn something new.
22656	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard effects the background information on Paul because Paul is not a good reader.  Mr. Leonard was not a good reader either, but he was really good at sports.  Mr. Leonard was a top college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdle race at the nationals and broke records.  This is teaching Paul, that no matter what happens in life, that being able to read is very important.  He shows Paul that he was a good athlete, but because he couldn't read, he didnt succeed to the best of his ability.
22657	8	When Paul finds out Mr. Leonard cannot read it motivates Paul to try harder jumping the hurdles to prove to Mr. Leonard you can overcome obstacles and he wants to impress him.
22658	8	It inspires Paul to do track and then helps him help Mr. Leonard. At the end, Paul said to Mr. Leonard that they were going to the learning center.
22659	8	The effect the background information has on Paul is interesting. Paul can't read and neither can Mr. Leonard. Mr Leonard was a track star and had everything going for him, but he didn't do good in college. Paul was feeling embarrassment because he knew exactly how Mr. Leonard felt.
22660	8	i think Pual was inspired bt Mr.Leonard and what he has done. paul wants to do things better and mr.Loenard tells him just to keep practicing.
22661	8	The background effect that Paul has is that he is downgraded, because of the way he gets chosen to do things in class. Paul gets affected by the things he's asked to do when some people knew he isn't that good at them, and they choose him anyways. Paul has to take a remedial reading program and he's dissapointed about it. Mr. Leonard comes up to him one day and confronts on where he's going and notices that Paul is having a hard time. Mr. Leonard has him come forward for achievment to maybe overcome his obstacles and become more faithful in himself.
22662	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul because he is very similar to Mr. Leonard. He learns that he may become very talented at hurdles but if he never improves his reading he may not be able to accomplish anything with his talent.
22663	8	When the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard, he feels an instant connection with him, and also a feeling of sympathy. When Mr. Leonard said 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read,' Paul felt a sense of sadness in Mr. Leonard's voice, and it instantly motivated him to train hard to succeed as a track runner. He knew it would make Mr. Leonard happy knowing that he had inspired and motivated another child who had a reading problem like he did to achieve great things and not let anything get in his way.
22664	8	He felt sorry for Mr. Leonard because he could have became a pro but he could not because he could not read. In the text Mr. Leonard said 'I was a good athlete' he said softly, 'but not a good student.' So Mr Leonard wanted Paul to be able to read and to become a good runner so he could go farther than Mr. Leonard did. Then paul had thought what he could do for Mr Leonard and that was to teach him how to read.
22665	8	Paul is not that great of a reader. Mr.Leonard helps him relize he can over come any obsticles in his life. Mr.Leonard can not read either, that's why he ask Paul what his name was at the track. Mr. Leonard movitates Paul to do a sport , and he might get a life lession out of it.

22667	8	He is surprised because Mr. Leoned didn't tell him that he was a great hurderler in college. He ask whe Mr. Leonard didnt tell him all this when they first started the training. Then when Mr. Leonard tells him why he understands because he feels the same way.
22668	8	Paul wanted to know why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he had been a college freshmen and broke the record for the 400 meter hurdles at the national level.After Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was kicked out of college because he couldn't read,he felt that he should help Mr. Leonard out, and train him to read better. He decided that he would help out Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard had helped him.
22669	8	When Mr. Leonard exposes his background as a kid to Paul, Paul feels his embarassment cause he goes through the same thing as what Mr. Leonard has gone through as a kid. Also Mr. Leonard wants to fulfill his dreams of being a star college track runner and wants Paul as his apprentice.
22670	8	When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard, he feels like he has something more in common with Mr. Leonard.

22675	8	That he was a track star and he did not want anyone to no.
22676	8	i think that paul could relate to mr. leonard because he went through the same problems that paul is going through. I think that  paul respects mr leonard because  hes taking the time to help him when no one else would

22684	8	The background information recieved by the reader about Mr. Leonard effects Paul by suprising and persuading him to stay in the hurdle jumps to relieve Mr. Leonard from his pass failure in hurdle jumps. Details from the story that support my response is when after Mr. Leonard told Paul about his pass, it was time to start Mr. Leonards training.

22750	8	The background information helped Paul understand that Mr. Leonard had the same problem in school. Mr. Leonard could not read but was very fast. This was very similar to Pauls life in school.
22751	8	Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler, and won medals, and broke records. He was in the nationals; however, Paul found this out because the track coach, and Paul realized that Mr. Leonard never told him why he wanted to hlep him out. So when Paul found out about this he brought it up to Mr. Leonard.
22752	8	The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard that has effected him is that, Mr. leonard went to college to be a track star. He was a very good athlete but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didnt get to take a learning class because there are none back then. Unlike now because Paul is takeing one. It effects him because it's what Paul is going throught right now.
22753	8	The background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by giving Paul more compassion towards Mr. Leonard. Paul sympathizes with Mr. Leonard. At first, Paul sees Mr. Leonard as a teacher and a coach. Mr. Leonard tells Paul how to jump a hurdle. Mr. Leonard tells Paul when to jump, lean, or use his arms and Paul willingly obeyed. When Paul leanrs the background information about Mr. Leonard, the relationship became deeper. Paul understood just how similar he is to Mr. Leonard. Paul also realized how much Mr. Leonard had helped him excel at hurdles. Paul began to understand Mr. Leonard and his life better once he obtained the background  information.
22754	8	When Paul starts to get background information on Mr. Leonard he starts to relise that he is going through the exact samething Mr. Leonard did. When he's walking to the learning center and Mr. Leonard stops him and Paul says 'Learning center' and that 'I can't read' and than he starts doing track hurdles and gets good at it, he finds out Mr.leonard use to be a great track athlete and he couldnt read so he flunked out of college. Now Paul was good at hurdles and was learning something Mr. Leonard never got s chance and that is to read.
22755	8	Paul is surprised to find that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner in college. He asked Mr. Leonard about him quitting and tried to find out more about Mr. Leonard's life. Paul can understand the embarassment of not being accepted because of a lack of knowledge and/or ability.
22756	8	The background revieled about Mr. Leonard that is layed out throughout the story has a great effect on Paul.  First of all, when Paul found out what Mr. Leonard used to do, he was very suprised.  Because of what was revealed within the story, the author reveals at the end of the story that Paul will later go on to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  If the reader would not get the background information about Mr. Leonard and how he could not read, then the end of the story would not make sense to us.  Also, it makes it more special for Paul that Mr. Leonard wants to teach him how to run hurdles because he exceled at that at one time.
22757	8	The background information Paul recieves makes him realize that there are other people out there that have some type of similar troubles in life.  When Mr. Leonard tells Paul that, 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read,' Paul can really connect to him because he feels the same way sometimes.  Paul says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'  Paul also decides to help Mr. Leonard in the same way Mr. leonard helped him.
22758	8	Mr. Leonard's background information is that he was a great athelete that broke records and was 'a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals,' but he had problems reading. Mr. Leonard didn't have any support or help with school. He had no tutors, and 'college work was a whole lot harder than high school work.' He said, 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'     Mr. Leonard's background information reminds Paul of his background as well. Paul went to the remedial reading program at his middle school. He felt empathetic that Mr. Leonard had with reading comprehension struggles. He understood the 'feelings of embarrassment' and was 'a select few in the remedial reading program.' Because Mr. Leonard had found him the great gift of hurdling, he did the same for Mr. Leonard.
22759	8	When Paul researches Mr. Leonard's name in the track and field website, he finds out that he was an amazing college track star and broke records. When asking Mr. Leonard about those past years, he explains that he flunked out because of his failing grades. Paul has '...feelings of embarrasment...' and has simpathy for Mr. Leonardo and realizes that 'This man [Mr. Leonard] had given his time to help me [Paul] excel at something.'. This gives Paul encouragement to help Mr. Leonard to help him learn how to read.
22760	8	The effect on Paul is tremendous because he finds out a possibility of why Mr. Leonard would choose him to train.  Mr. Leonard never mentioned his accomplishments because he did not want to discourage Paul and him begin to think that he could not be as good as Mr. Leonard was.  Paul realizes that they are familiar and it makes him feel more comfortable that Mr. Leonard was like him when he was in high school.  Paul was shocked and happy to see that the person who was training him also was somebody who went to nationals and broke records.  Mr. Leonard was helping him excel at something that he was good at and then Paul wanted to do the same for him.
22761	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul receives helps Paul connect with Mr. Leonard. Paul states, ' The emothions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' when Mr. Leonard told Paul he could not read. It also makes him feel more confident.
22762	8	Drawing sympathy from his own embarrassments, Paul responds kindly to the revelations about Mr. Grabowski.This is manifested in two things that the readers see.First, Paul experiences an upwelling of emotion when he hears Mr. Grabowski's story and compares it to his own. Second, Paul's kindness is manifested in his encouraging Mr. Grabowski at the close of the story.
22763	8	The backround information will help him learn That he needs to learn how to read and get threw high school.
22764	8	Paul had no idea about the past of Mr. Leanord. So when he found out about his records that he set in college he was excited. Paul just wanted to know more about the hall monitor.
22765	8	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that he is quick to listen to Mr. Leonard. The following sentence from the text describes Mr. Leonard directing Paul to the track. ''Follow me,' he directed, and, obediently, I followed.'(Gifts 13).
22766	8	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can not read, he feels related to him.  Paul feels grateful that Mr. Leonard helped him, so Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard with reading by escorting him to the school.
22767	8	He felt bad for him, knowing that he was a really good athlete.Then finding out that he flunked out of school, and had to quit track. So he is helping him out, since coach helped him out.
22768	8	Paul learned all the backgroung information of Mr. Leonard and was shock. Mr. Leonard was actually a track star in college. Paul couldn't believe he had never knew about this.Paul was confused to why Mr. Leonard never told him anout his Past in track and field.
22769	8	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he broke records, but Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.
22770	8	The background information has a huge effect to Paul. Paul realizes that everyone has their struggles in life and that not everyone is perfect. He can relate to Mr. Leonard in the feeling of embarassment and this helps Paul to learn and understand that Mr.Leonard is helping him excel.Paul looked at the experience as a way to help not only him, but Mr.Leonard too.
22771	8	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his past he seemed to have a connection with him and really understand how he felt, because he also feels like that when he has been called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know an asnwer everyone else knew because he too has a hard time in reading.
22772	8	Paul see's he is like Mr. Leonard in more ways then one, and because of this he wants to help his teacher lern to read. such as the ending when he states, ' C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
22773	8	The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because they have similar problems and now an interest, which is hurdles.

22776	8	Getting background information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel like there is hope for a good athlete who cant read very well.  He just has to work hard.
22777	8	I think that the storys Mr. Leonard has for Paul are motivation to him because he can relate very well.  He, like Mr. Leonard, does not do well in school and he feels like this guy has been down this road so I should listen to him.  He does not know how to turn someone down so he follows what Mr. Leonard says because its better than doing school work.
22778	8	paul is leonard best freind so they are tight
22779	8	The information Paul gets from the background check makes Paul even more determined to be a better reader and get good grades. Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard because if Paul didn't get help reading he could end up just like Mr. Leonard. 'This man gad given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him'. It shows that this article effected Paul because he knows he wouldn't be anything without Mr. Leonard so he helps him to get better at what he struggles with.
22780	8	When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had a learning problem when he was in school, it made him not feel as alone and isolated. You can tell this because you can almost scense a bond between the two after that story. Also, the way Paul said, 'It's time to start your training.' hinted that Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard.
22781	8	When Paul discovers the background information about Mr. Leonard, he is very touched. He feels a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard academically and feels the same pain Mr. Leonard had.

22783	8	paul  wondered why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him he was a track and feild champion. But Mr Leonard was kinda ashamed to tell Paul about his problem .
22784	8	He's empathetic and understanding. The author writes, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I know them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alound or when I didn't know an anser everyone else knew' (p. 45). The narrator understood why Mr. Leonard had begun coaching him in hurdles.
22785	8	Once he went and looked up that Mr. Leonard was a star track athleat he was courious that y he stoped doing it. After doing some digging he was able to find out that he was not a good reader him self. He also found that he fluncked out of colage and he was simpothetic and wanted to help him regane his confodince.
22786	8	The background on Mr. Leonard effected Paul by giving him confidence that he can do anything and that he is not the only one that has trouble reading. Mr. Leonard had trouble reading in college just like Paul has trouble reading and Paul does him a favor and started training him, just like what Mr. Leonard did.
22787	8	He get's confused on why Mr. Leonard never told him or even mentioned that he used to be a runner. Once he knew about it,he wanted to become a runner that could read,to live on Mr. Leonard's dream.
22788	8	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is Paul feels stunned at the talent that Mr. Leonard once had, and doesn't understand why he stopped doing something he was so good at.  An example would be in paragraph 35 when Paul says 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  This resulted in Mr. Leonard to go on to say, 'I was a good athlete...but not a good student,' found in paragraph 42.
22789	8	Paul, when stopped by Mr. Leonard at the beginning of the story, is ashamed at the fact that he can not read. Mr. Leonard then seeks out to Paul because in his past he shared similar problems as Paul, not being able to sucessfully read. With this newly formed bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard he feels motivated to continue his sucess.
22790	8	The effect is that Paul now knows that someone else went through what he is going through now. Paul does not have to feel just apart of the 'select few'.
22791	8	That Paul is shy and not very athletic. Reasons for this is that in this story Paul gets picked last for teams.
22792	8	When Paul read about Mr. Leonard's background, he kind of felt honored to be noticed by a great athlete who broke records.  Paul had always thought he would not make it that far as all the other kids because he could not read.  Also, Paul stated that, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.  Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'  He thinks since he was helped, he will help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22793	8	Paul learns some similarities between him and Mr. Leonard. These similarities help him realize that Mr. Leonard does know how he feels, and is trying to help him succeed. Then Paul seems to decide to return the favor, as it is implied that he is going to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
22794	8	The background information Paul had on Mr. Leonard had an encouraging and motivating effect on him. Not only did Paul get motivated to do his best, but he also got motivated to help Mr. Leonard get reading help.
22795	8	Some information that Paul got about Mr. Leonard is very effective to Paul for many reasons.  One reason is that Paul felt bad for Mr. Leonard.  Because of what happened to Mr. Leonard, Paul wanted to help him and Paul wanted to do better as a student.  Paul will now probably want to focus more and do better himself, to not end of like Mr. Leonard.
22796	8	Paul is surprised at first to hear that Mr. Leonard was a track star. From the backgroung information, Paul relizes that Mr. Leonard isn't much different from himself. They both had a problem with their education, but had talent for the hurdles.
22797	8	He is surprised that he was such a good althete back then . And why he never talks about it to anyone at school , or anything . Also , that he was confused on how he had lost his scholarship .And that he can do the same thing when he gets older , he just got to belive in himsilf an his goals will pull through.
22798	8	Shows Paul that there are many things in life. And that even though you cant read everyone has a talent.
22799	8	The background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard is shocking to him. Paul didn't think that Mr. Leonard would have flunked out of college because of his inferior intelligence. Most importantly it encouraged him to keep trying to do his very best. Once he asked Mr. Leonard about this and heard it all the way it was he felt inspired. 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student' (lines 42-43). Paul knew the feelings that Leonard had.
22800	8	The backgroud information about Mr. Leonard gives Paul a sense of hope. Mr. Leonard share his passion for hurdles and Paul excells at it. Paul is shown that a person can live their dreams even if they are the last person picked in gym class. Paul can feel important about doing something very well.
22801	8	The background information we get on Paul shows how shy he is. We understand why he doesn't go out for things such as sports since he was embarrassed about going to the Learning center.
22802	8	He listens to all of the information so he knows alot about Mr. Lenonard.
22803	8	Paul is suprised that he was a track star and even more suprised to hear that he flunked out but he is not discouraged.
22804	8	The information that Paul recieves on Mr. Leonard inspires Paul.  Paul felt very connected with Mr. Leonard.  He felt like they were very similar.  Knowing that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete and bad at school made Paul feel as if he could become a great athlete.  The author says, ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'
22805	8	Finding out that Mr. Leonard was a highschool track star who could not read gives Paul a friend and someone who was once in his shoes. Now that Paul has learned how to be a great runner he wants to help Mr. Leonard become a great reader.
22806	8	During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard. He was a college track star who broke records at the nationals. Paul, after realizing who Mr. Leonard was, was surprised at the fact that Mr. Leonard is now merely a hall monitor. Paul expected Mr. Leonard to be living the successful life as he broke records only as a college freshman. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul sympathized with him because like him, Mr. Leonard had the similar reading diorder. Paul 'knew the emotions well- feelings of embarassment when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew'. Paul became motivated to helped the man who helped him excel at something.
22807	8	The background that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard can affect him by how Paul is in school. In the story it talks about how twice a week Paul went to the school basement to learn and you found out that Mr. Leonardo had the same problem.
22808	8	Paul is pretty happy that he was just trained by a guy who broke records in collge for the 400 meter dash. But he wants to try to teach him how to read after he found out that his coach flunked out of college.
22809	8	Paul simpathizes for Mr. Leonard but wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me?'. Mr. Leonard replied with simple facts that leads us to believe that he was simply ashamed and embarassed.
22810	8	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonards background he is suprised and motivated. Paul learns that, like himself, Mr. Leonard had reading problems but was still confident in another area in his life. Mr. Leonard also explains that they didn't have learning centers like Paul does now.
22811	8	The Information help Paul learn more about Mr. Leonard And the struggles he delt with in college. When Mr. Leonard said that the college scouts said his grade didn't matter But and they'll find a tutor to help him, But Mr. Leonard replied that the work was hard then high school work. Mr. Loenard lost his scholarship and flunked out of college. No other school wanted a runner that couldn't read.
22812	8	The effect that the background information has on paul is that it encourages him to succeed just like Mr. Leonard did. Mr. Leonard didn't know how to read just like paul but he tried jumping hurdles and that made him successful. Paul followed in Mr. Leonards footsteps and Paul turned out to be successful just like Mr. Leonard.
22813	8	He does not understand why Mr. Leonard had never told him how good a hurdler he was. Then Mr. Leonard explained why he never told him when the narrator confronted him about it.
22814	8	The information he finds out about Mr. Leonard reminds him of himself, because he isn't doing well in school and neither did Mr. Leonard.
22815	8	For Paul to find out that he isn't the only one who can't read very well while participating in a sport has to be encouraging. If i had struggles reading and my football coach came up to me and i told me that when he was a kid he struggled with the same thing, I would be motivated. Not motivated to flunk out of college, but to reach my full potential.      Earlier in the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard that he is always picked last in gym class, so why would he want to be picked last after school. At this point he has no motivation, but when he starts to become good at the hurdles and Mr. Leonard tells him this, I believe that this was just the motivation he needed to reach his full potential.
22816	8	The information about Paul says hes a poor reader. But Mr. Leonard is helping him out on somethings.
22817	8	The narrator was suprised to find that Mr. Leonard was a track star and wondered why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past.
22818	8	Well I think that he dident tell Paul because He dident want him to be in amaziment and be never about runing
22819	8	He found out that the hall monitor had a scholarship and he didnt keep his grades up so he lost his scholarship. It effects the background because Paul does good in school and does well in track.
22820	8	Paul finds out he was just like Mr. Leonard when he was in school. Mr. Leonard couldnt read either. He flunked out of college and Mr. Leonard didnt want the same thing to happen to Paul so he coached him up in track and field because he knew he could get some where because he was learning how to read.
22821	8	When Paul reads the background information about Mr. Leonard, he learns about the man.  Its effect is that he is upset that he wasn't told about Mr. Leonard being a track star.
22822	8	It as an effect because  he dont kno what to do nor know what to say about the information he as gotting.
22823	8	When Paul got the background information and read it about Mr. Leonard, he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't good at school. Paul knew exactly how he felt. Mr. Leonard was feeling embarassment when he was in college because he couldn't read, or wasn't good at school.
22824	8	The effect of the background from Mr. Leonard gave Paul encouragement. It showed him that he should take advantage to what he is given and use it. Mr. Leonard didn't have the option to get a lot of help reading, so just being a runner didn't get him so far. Mr. Leonard wanted to show that to Paul. He wanted to show him that he could do anything he wanted. At the end of the story Paul decided he would give back a little and help Mr. Leonard to read.
22825	8	The backround information that Paul recieves on Mr. Leonard makes Paul respect Mr. Leonard more. Paul is shocked that his trainer ran track and was a superstar at running.
22826	8	The reader gets background information about Mr.Leonard,'not a bad first effort,' commented Mr.Leonard as I staggered in. ' That was terrible,'I gasped. 'You'll do better next time,'he responde. 'Bring sneakers and shorts tomorrow.' 'Right,'I panted. Mr. Leonard began walking back toward the school, then turned and asked. 'Say, whats your name?' 'Paul.' It didnt occur to me until later that this was an odd question for someone who had checked my hall pass twice a week.
22827	8	This was good but ownly if he would payed attend in class he would not have been a trouble reader. He did go to a learner class to get better at it so he can coach more people in hurdle an he did it .
22828	8	I moved beside him and pointed to the photograph. 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'
22829	8	The effect of the background information on Paul is very inspiring because they both have reading problems. This would inspire him because, just because you are not good at something does not mean you cant do anything. his coach has the same problem and became a great runner in track.
22830	8	As the story progresses Paul starts to suspect something about Mr. Leonard. When he joins the high school track team and his coach tells him to do a search on Mr. Leonard, he finds out about his past. Which makes him relize that he still doesn't know who to read over all the years. Making him feel empathetic for Mr. Leonard.
22831	8	Paul feels inspired because he now understands that even though Mr. Grabowski couldn't read, he still went on to win the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. He knows that he can somewhat relate to Mr. Grabowski and the background information inspired him to not be discouraged from running just because he can't read.
22832	8	when paul foundout who mr. Leonard was it inspired him to help other people starting with Mr. Leonard
22833	8	Paul understood why Mr. Leonard really wanted to help him.  Paul understands now that he can get through obstacles even when they are tough.  Paul didn't think he would ever be good at hurdles, but since he kept practicing he got better.  Now, he can keep practicing reading and get better at that too.  He wants to help Mr. Leonard read too, since he helped him.  If Paul didn't know this about Mr. Leonard he may have just given up.
22834	8	The back ground info was something very personall to Mr leonard and a big part in this past. but it made paul realize why he was acting the way he was.
22835	8	The effect the background had on Paul was that him and Mr. Leonard had stuff in common they both have trouble reading. The school didn't have a learning center so Mr. Leonard couldn't get help with his learning like Paul could so Paul decided to start training Mr.Leoando.
22836	8	When the narraotor, Paul, finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is amazed by Mr. Leonard's accomplishments. In paragraph 38 Paul enthusiastically told Mr. Leonard about winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. His coach's achievments, and his past about being a poor student made Paul feel empathetic and finally decides to help Mr. Leonard the same person who helped him.
22837	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard affected Paul by helping Paul realize that him and Mr. Leonard weren't so different after all. It says that it reminded Paul of the feelings of embarrassment when he was called upon to read but he didn't know how. Also, he wanted to do what Mr. Leonard helped him with and that is to succeed at something complicated. For Paul, it's track and for Mr. Leonard, it's reading.
22838	8	The effect of the background is emotional when Mr. Leonard Grabowski was reading the printed out article.
22839	8	When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard, he feels empathetic. Paul has become really good at track, but he isn't a good reader either. In 'Gifts', Mr. Leonard asks Paul where hes going. Paul answered, 'To the learning center.' He tells Mr. Leonard that he can't read. Mr. Leonard can't read either. He has seen Paul's hall pass many times and still has to ask what his name is.
22840	8	Mr. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athlete but not a good student. Mr. Leonard flunked and was upset. When Leonard helped Paul with the hurdlers, Paul began to think how he felt as well. Paul thought he was similar to Leonard when it came to school. Lenonard gave Paul some encouragement when it came to school.
22841	8	In the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but later finds out that he couldn't read. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because he has to go to a remedial reading program because its hard for him to read. By Paul finding out this information, he realizes why Mr. Leonard has been helping him with the hurdles; they had shared the same feelings throughout their lives. Then, Paul understands that he can help Mr. Leonard to read, just as he has helped Paul to learn hurdles and to get through obstacles in life.
22842	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard caused Paul to feel bad for him. Mr. Leonards school, 'had no learning centers.' Paul wanted to help him, and said, ' C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.' Paul is helping him learn to read.
22843	8	The effect of finding out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and broke records, motivated Paul I think. If some hall monitor that made me great a sport but yet to tell the astonishing achievements he's made that'd motivate me, Paul can't read and neither can Mr. Leonard so that kinda made Paul relate.
22844	8	Paul wants to know more about Mr. Leonard. After discovering that he was a star, Paul wanted why Mr. Leonard never told anyone. Paul wanted to know more. Paul was interested in him. When he told Paul that it was the best race of his life, Paul wanted to know what happened to him.
22845	8	It made him understand Mr. Leonard better and why he wanted him to do the hurdles adn why he was helping him train. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. '
22846	8	he is excited that the guy that is training him is a old college hurdler that has records ad is good. but he wants to kow what happend to all of that and then he asked mr. leonard.
22847	8	It showed Paul that not everyone is who you think they are, because I'm pretty sure Paul didn't know who Mr. Leonard really was. He didn't know anything about him. After reading the background information on that website he was prbably shocked, maybe even confused.
22848	8	blah blah blah
22849	8	Mr. Leonard was just like Paul he couldn't read but was good at track but Paul didnt like anything but he knew alittle about track so Mr. Leonard started to train Paul and Paul began to get better and better each day so good he went to the track coach and he want Paul to work out with the track team for the high school so he went ack and asked Mr. Leonard if it was a good idea and he smile and sadi yes but at that time Paul din't know about him and how he was just like Paul and found out that Mr. leonard was just like him had to do everythig like Paul but still wasn't able to finish out college.
22850	8	Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a college track runner. He had no idea he ran and broke records. Paul was suprised by the information he read and asked Mr. Leonard a lot questions and questioned him about college track and his career as a runner.
22851	8	I think it kind of shows Paul a new respect for Mr. Leonard because of how good he was and it opens an opportunity for Mr. Leonard to share a little about himself with Paul.
22852	8	The emotions that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to him.
22853	8	Mr. Leonard could not read but was a very good hurdler. He set the record for the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman in college. He had only one problem, he was not very smart. Back in his time, there were no learning centers, so Mr. Leonard relied on his friends to get by. When Mr. Leonard got to college, classes became tougher and he eventually flunked out. This inspires Paul to be able to read and start to get good grades. Paul then decides that he will 'train' Mr. Leonard to read like Mr. Leonard has trained Paul to hurdle.
22854	8	In the story, the reader learns that Mr. Leonard did not care about his grades in college, but that he was more focused on sports. This effects Paul because he struggles with grades too, but he can relate and feel paralell to Mr. Leonard.
22855	8	When Mr. Leonard reveals his past to Paul, he see's things differently and more understanding. He feels he and Mr. Leonard have the same problem and that he should take school very seriously and try harder. Mr. Leonard pushs him to do his best and suggest nothing but the good for the young high schooler. And for him to not end up like he. So try hard.
22856	8	In the begining of the story when Paul first starts his training Mr. Leonard asks for his name. Paul simply found it odd that Mr. Leonard had to ask when he had seen his hall pass multiple times before. After paul trys out for the team he learns that Mr. Leonard can't read and that paul would feel the same.
22857	8	When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, he becomes interested. He asks questions about why Mr. Leonard quit. Paul felt like he knew the feelings of flunking out or being embarrassed due to his inability to read as well as other students. Also, he decides to tutor him like Mr. Leonard tutored him.
22858	8	he is quite happy to know about the inside information about Mr.Leonard.
22859	8	The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard that the reader finds out about has a specific impact on Paul.           After Paul had found out about Mr. Leonard's past he confronted him about it, and began to learn that his 'select few' people that had to go to the learning center, because they weren't able to read wasn't so limited. He realized that there are other people that have the same difficulty, and he had more in common with Mr. Leonard as he had originally thought. Paul also realized that although Mr. Leonard couldn't read, he was able to help him with running, and now that Paul had the advantage that Mr. Leonard didn't have, which was the availability to go to a learning center, he was able to help Mr. Leonard defeat something he had been struggling with when he was Paul's age.
22860	8	The background story was surprising to Paul. He was excited to here that Mr. Leonard was a track star. He wanted to learn more about what happened and why he quite. He later learns that Mr. Leonard cannot read well. He is surprised to here this and it motivates him to achieve more in his school work.
22861	8	Mr. Leonard doesn't really have any information on Paul because he can not really read so when he see's Paul in the hall ways that is when he finds out a little more each time.
22862	8	He was confused because Mr. Leonard never shared with him that he was a great hurdler in college.  He knew something had to be up since Mr. Leonard never shared these achievements with him.  This is why Paul asked him what happened after he confronted him about it.
22863	8	Once Paul finds out Mr. Leonard's background information he gets curious as to why Mr. Leonard never told him about anything. He didn't know that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college so he was confused about having the information hid from him.
22864	8	In paragraph 45 the narrarator talks bout how he knew how Mr. Leonard felt when when he had to indur this, he knew the feeling of embarassment. he knew exactly what Mr. Leonard had went though.
22865	8	Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul wonder. He was able to relate to him and understand his interest in him. The both shared a difficulty in school and the embarrassment they both had because of it.
22866	8	Well i think he should of whent and learn how to read when he was a little boy. I thimk it was a good thing he got into sports i think that made him whant to read more.
22867	8	When Paul finds out what happened to Mr. Leonard he realized that Mr. Leonard was going threw the same thing when he was a kid. This motovates Paul to not only keep up his good school work, and track, it motovates him to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
22868	8	The back ground information shows paul that Mr.Leonard was just like him when he was younger. Mr.Leonard had trouble reading also so he turned to sports as a outlet. But he didn't want paul to do the same things he did.
22869	8	It makes Paul feel better about Mr. Leonard because he now knows that Mr. Leonard struggled in school just as he is now.
22870	8	He hear about the information and is encoreged to do the same. He trys harder in the story.
22871	8	Getting the background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul greatly. It effects Paul because when Mr. Leonard was in school he had the same problem as Paul did, causing him not to succeed at what he wanted to do. When he figured out about Mr. Leonard and what happened after talking to him about his past he wanted to help him with his reading, like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his running, causing him to succeed at a sport.
22872	8	Paul is suprised when he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past track success.  When he finds out that Mr. Leonard also had a hard time reading, Paul is encouraged to make Mr. Leonard proud of him through his running.  Paul is also inspired to help Mr. Leonard.  Mr. Leonard introduced Paul to running, which became very important to him.  He wants to repay Mr. Leonard, so he is going to teach him how to read.
22873	8	When Paul found out who Mr. Leonard was he realized that they were alike in some ways like not being able to read. he found out that Mr. Leonard was a really good athelete but did not know how to read.
22874	8	During the story, the reader get background information about Mr. Leonard. The background information has an effect on Paul because now he wants students to do their best in school work and know how to read. In the passage Mr. Leonard said college work is a lot harder than high school work. I think Mr. Leonard wants students to know that now and work hard. If they are a good athlete they need to think about their grades too.
22875	8	Paul really feels for Mr. Leonard and feels like not only can Mr. Leonard help him he can help Mr. Leonard. He feels happy that he can return the favor that Mr. Leonard has done for him. So Paul takes Mr. Leonard and leads him back to the school and tells him that it is time to start his training. This is very good for Paul because Paul knows the same feelings that Mr. Leonard is feeling and they can help each other along.
22876	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a positive effect on Paul. I believe that when Mr. Leonard told Paul that he didn't know how to read and they kicked him out of college, it made Paul want to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was proud that Paul was going to the remedial reading program. Paul was going to be able to read. Mr. Leonard wanted Pal to know how to read so he would not get rejected from getting into college.
22877	8	it has an effect on Paul, because by using Mr. leonards past to help him succeed in his future.
22878	8	He knew how Mr. Leonard felt. He said that the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words were all too familiar to him.
22879	8	As Paul gets backround information on Mr. Leonard, he realizes that he was a great athlete who set records at the national track meet as a freshman in college.  He wonders why he was never told about this, and when Mr. Leonard gives him the answer, it inspires him to begin his training, implying that he is going to work with him on his reading.
22880	8	Paul is astounded to hear that Mr. Leonard is not that smart, but a great athlete. He sees that ambarressed look on Mr. Leonard's face, what paul normally has, and tries to help him.
22881	8	From the story 'Gifts', the background information revealed about Mr. Leonard gives Paul the motivation an inspiration to succeed in track and field, just like his coach. After knowing a a person whom has succeeded in what he wants to become good at, he finds Mr. Lenoard to be a role model. After finding the college picture of his coach, Paul can relate to him as he looks at Mr. Leonard, then 'smiles sadly at the image on the page'.
22882	8	Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving alnog  from one classroom to next.Paul  is a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
22883	8	Paul starts to emphazise with Mr.Leonard. He talks about how when he was called on during class and he didn't know the answer.
22884	8	The background information shows Paul that he can be a great athelete even through he can't read. It also gives Paul a role model.
22885	8	The effect it has on paul is it relates to him. The story Mr. Leonard told him of himself was the story paul was living.
22886	8	The effect that the background information has on paul is that he had trouble reading like Mr. Leonard did, but if he works hard he can get better at it.
22887	8	Paul was a little upset that Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his college past as a track star. Paul understood everything that happened to Mr. Leonard. He understands the feeling of being embarrassed for not being able to read. Paul is gracious that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, so Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read.
22888	8	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was very similar to him when he was in school. He couldn't read but could do track extremely well. Paul sees this and it makes him think that if he could help Mr. Leonard like he is with Paul, maybe Mr. Leonard could be great again and overcome his past.
22889	8	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to be a great hurdler when he was in high school and college. Mr. Leornard tells Paul that he couldn't do it anymore because he couldn't read and his grades were bad. This probably effected Paul because he also couldn't read and he was learning how to hurdle. But Paul is getting tudored to read so in the long run he will be able to be a great hurdler and succeed.
22890	8	The background information Paul got from Mr. Leonard, made him understand why Mr. Leonard made him train for track. Paul felt like he can achieve anything with practice, and it made him want to help Mr. Leonard achieve what he believed he couldn't.
22891	8	Having background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by giving him the knowledge that his trainer, and now friend, had a high school experience just like his. Paul knows they are in the same boat and that Mr. Leonard is concerned in helping him excel with something and he is honored.'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me.' and 'This man had given up his time to help me excel at something.'
22892	8	After Paul researches Grabowski on the track and field website, he realizes that Leonard used to be a professional athlete. That Grabowski broke records or won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, but then Paul learns that Leonard has the same problem he does. Paul learns that Leonard can't read and that he flunked out of college. Then Paul starts to feel sympathetic for Leonard because he now knows that Leonard is very similar to him.
22893	8	This is a story about an illiterate, not so special boy named Paul who strikes up an unlikely friendship with his school's hall monitor Mr. Leonard.     The first day Paul meets Mr. Leonard Paul reveals to him that he cannot read and because of that he has to go to a remedial reading program. At that moment I believe that Mr. Leonard saw a little bit of himself in Paul, but nevertheless he ushered him along.     After awhile of abrupt somewhat menial encounters Mr. Leonard decided to help Paul become a somebody. He instructed Paul to meet him at the gym that day after school. Paul agreed, and that afternoon entered the gym to see the basketball team practicing for intermurals and Mr. Leonard watching intently. Mr. Leonard quickly learns that Paul has shown no real sign or interest in sports greatness, always being picked last for teams in gym and how disheartening it is to Paul. Paul had just grown used to it. Mr. Leonard takes him out to the track and they begin to practice hurdles. Mr. Leonard has somewhat of a hidden agenda due to his past as a track star. After awhile of training Paul tries out for the track team and when asked if it was Mr. Leonard who trained him, he nods and is given a key to his trainers past. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a successful track star, breaking records and setting the bar for future track runners to beat. But when he asks Mr. Leonard about it he shrugs it of and tells Paul why he had to give it up. He put his passion above his learning, and because of that he failed. In the end he just wanted soemone like him to suceed. And as it turns out Paul is a nice guy and decided to scratch his mentors back as a thank you. The story ends with it suggesting Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.     This hows Paul empathizes with his new friend and mentor, and he want to help Mr. Leonard suceed the way he helped him.
22894	8	He gets background information that Mr. Leonard droped out of collage and he was in track.  He also caried about the narrator because he seen that he was always last to be picked for sports.
22895	8	The backround information Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is that he was track super star. That effected Paul because Mr. Leonard told him he had to stop, because he couldn't read good. It gave Paul motivation.
22896	8	Because of his feelings of embarrassment, when  he was called upon on, to read outload or when he didnt know an answer that everybody else new. so pretty much he was ebarssin to answer.cause of the frieght he might get the wrong answer..he wasnt to confidant.
22897	8	Once Paul is exposed to the personal story that Mr. Leonard shares with him, he gets a better understanding of why Mr. Leonard is trying to help him. Mr. Leonard was in a similar position as Paul with a reading disability. But, Mr. Leonard didn't have the same resources that Paul does with the Learning Center, and that resulted in his loss of a scholarship. By Mr. Lonard sharing the story, Paul realizes that he has the chance to be successful and overcome goals because of what he has been given.
22898	8	In the story 'Gifts', Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard also can not read. He finds out that Mr. Leonard was good at hurdles, just like Paul is. When Mr. Leanard tells Paul about his college disaster, Paul knew the feeling of embarassment and could relate to Mr. Leonard.      Instead of being angry that Mr. Leonard had never told Paul of his reading dissabilities, he decided to help Mr. Leonard out by teaching him how to read.
22899	8	Once Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an outstanding track and field athlete in college, but also that he was a poor reader Paul realizes he can relate with Mr. Leonard. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to [him]' and he knew the struggles that Mr. Leonard endured.
22900	8	When the narrator gets background information about Mr. Leonard, he's suprised at what he reads. He ultimately wants to know why he was never told about Mr. Leonards achievements because they were so good. Then later Paul finds out that he never knew this information because Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read. This hits home for Paul and he now wants to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard helped him.
22901	8	Paul is affected by it because he is just like Mr. Leonard back when he used to go to school. Paul was failing classes and he couldn't read. Also, he feels very embarassed.
22902	8	Paul is still confadent in his coach and wishes to learn from him and have him learn himself
22903	8	Paul can easily relate to Mr. Leonard's feelings of being shut out or not accepted. Paul is used to being the last one picked for sports teams in gym class, and Mr. Leonard is used to never being a successful reader. They both discover that they can use eachothers strengths to improve their weaknesses.
22904	8	he finds out that Mr. leonard had flunked out of college and was a former hurdler.
22905	8	That he used to do track and field. He doesnt know how to read, So he's going to get help on reading. He dropped out of college. Hes a nice guy, and so on.
22906	8	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read just like Paul can't.
22907	8	The background information that Paul recieves from Mr. Leonard really cheanges Paul's point of view on his track skills. Some of the things in the story that changed Paul's view was when Mr. Leonard told him about his challenges, so this makes Paul feel that even though he has challenges, he can still over come them because Mr. Leonard over came his disability to read and he is still good at what he does. Mr. Leonard is also still a really good 'coach' even if he can't read. If Mr. Leonard helps out Paul, he may help Leonard learn how to read, and if Leonard learns how to read, he could maybe go back to college and learn some stuff about his wanted job, and if he gets his job then he could be a coach for a major league team or he could even join in and be a part of the olympic team management for his country.
22908	8	It made Paul realize that he wasn't the only person that wasn't very smart. It also helped him realize that even though you have things in your life that might slow you down, you can always succeed with hard work.
22909	8	Paul was very surprised by what he found out about Mr. Leonard. Paul feels bad for him and wants to find out more about his younger life. Paul encourages Mr. Leonard to begin training again, and it inspires Paul to work hard at track and to be very successful.
22910	8	he wanted his job back.
22911	8	Paul is surprised to see that Leonard was a track record breacker. But dident contune becuse he wasent a good student and coulde't reads.
22912	8	Paul is supprised that Mr. Leonard was in track but at the same time he was wondering why he hasn't told him yet. Then Paull gets a little bit inspired to do better in track and start to train harder.
22913	8	He was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a record breaking hurdle jumper.  He realized when Mr. Leonard explained that he was good but what stopped him was his education because he needed help and the help he needed was offered there for him.
22914	8	The background information that Paul recives could help inspire him to do better on the track. The information could also fill the reader in on why he wanted to help paul.
22915	8	they both have a hard time reading
22916	8	The backgrounsd information that Paul here's about Mr. Leonard make Paul think a little about it. It make paul relize that Mr. Leanard was like him back in his time and also couldn't read. As Leanard was telling Paul about his passed it had also make him relize that Leanard only wants Paul to do good and make it. Try to make it so that Paul can take over his spot as well so that the school can accept him. Unlike Mr. Leanard was accepted back in his time when being an athlete that couldn't read.
22917	8	The background information Paule gets about his teeacher makes him realize what a great athlete his teacher had once ben. In that I think that he earns more respect for his coach, and ;he wants to know more about him. So it is a suprize to Paule when he finds out that his coach never got to live his dream because he could not read and that gives Paule more confidence to fallow his own dreams.
22918	8	During the story, the as readers, we get background information about Mr.Leonard.  This background information effects Paul.  Now Paul understands why Mr.Leonard is pushing him.  Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete, however he lacked in the education department.  Paul is going out of his way to get help where he struggles in the education department, and Mr. Leonard now also wants to show him somethings from athletics.
22919	8	The background information about Mr. Leonard shows that Mr. Leonard has had a similar education struggle like Paul has. Mr. Leonard can relate to Paul because he has had hard times with school before.
22920	8	Paul in my opinion was kind of upset but not furious because he stated ' Why didnt you tell me about this' , but still finished a conversation with Mr. Leonard.
22921	8	During this story and Mr. Leonard telling his back ground informattion to paul meant alot to him, because him opening up and telling Paul all of this is showing him that this isnt the way paul needs to turn out to be. Mr. Leonard wants paul to be sucuessful and not to fail out of college and to keep his head up and find extra activies to keep him self busy.
22922	8	he finds out that he broke records as a freshmen and is wondering why he quit because he was so good.
22923	8	In the beginning of the story Paul does not know that much about Mr. Leonard. He thought he was just a boring hall monitor. When he found out that Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and had flunked out of college, Paul was shocked. He found out that he could not read just like him. Since Mr. Leonard had helped Paul. Paul thought it would only be fair if he helped Mr. Leonard. So Paul felt empathetic for him and is now going to help him read.
22924	8	The background information Paul receives regarding Mr. Leonard gave Paul the ability to sympathize with him. He, like Mr. Leonard, was a talented track and field athlete, who had difficulty learning how to read. Paul says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me.' I also beleive that Paul is truely touched due to the help of Mr. Leonard. He realizes that 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something.'
22925	8	When Paul learned about Mr.Leonard's past, it made him feel more connected with him. He knew the emotions of Mr.Leonard because he struggled with the same problem. Paul knew how it felt to get embarrassed when he couldn't read something in class.
22926	8	When Paul finds out the history of Mr. Leonard he is shocked didnt realize why he cared so much about what Paul did. After seeing Mr. Leonard past and that he broke record he was concernd and determind to find out why Mr. Leonard wasnt in Track and Field anymore. Once Paul found out why he realized that was close to his kind of sistuation.
22927	8	It makes him question why he is only the hall monitor instead of a track coach or teacher.
22928	8	The reader understands better that Paul is just an average kid that has academic trouble.
22929	8	Beofre learning of this information, Mr. Leonard seems like any other person: A hall monitor, someone to follow orders from. However, Mr. Leonard is actually just like Paul, and, upon learning that, it's clear that they can make a connection. With that connection, the two can learn from each other and excel together.
22930	8	It inspires Paul to start teaching Mr. Leonard to read. Paul has gotten help from Mr. Leonard with something that they both enjoy, but once he finds out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college, he realizes that he could help him in return. Thus, inspriring him to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
22931	8	Paul was sort of mad when Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was an amazing athlete in collge as a freshman. I think it motivates him now that someone is coaching him that was a great athlete.
22932	8	During the story Paul finds out more about Mr. Leonard than he knew in the beginning. When Paul gets the information about Mr. Leonard, he is shocked. Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard kept his past away from him. After Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about his past, Paul realizes that he is walking in Mr. Leonard's footsteps. They had more in common than he had realized. The key point is when Paul realizes how much they had in common when Mr. Leonard said, 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. That quote explains to Paul more than anything that Mr. Leonard knows what Paul goes through and he is trying to help Paul by making sure he has good grades and is a track star. Mr. Loenardo's past had a large effect on Paul because they had so much more in common.
22933	8	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke college hurdle records. Mr. Leonard doesn't want to tell anyone about the records because he is embarrassed by the fact that he flunked out of college.
22934	8	The background information reveals to Paul why Mr. Leonard wants him to succeed at the hurdles. Learning about MR. Leonard's difficulties in school and reading causing him to flunk out makes Paul empathetic towards Mr. Leonard and makes him not only want to do better at the hurdles to make him proud, but also to help Mr. Leonard to repay him for his help. Paul stated, 'It's time to start your training.' By this he meant Mr. Leonard's training to learn to read.
22935	8	At the end of the story the reader comes to find Mr. Leonard has a learning impediment just like Paul. When Paul finds this out he understands what this man felt, 'I knew them well- feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew...'. Through understanding comes realization as Paul thinks about how Mr. Leonard took time to help him excel at something and he decides to help Mr. Leonard overcome his learning problems. 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' He then took Mr. Leonard to begin his training.
22936	8	The effect that background information has on Paul is, he is going through the same things. He also probably thought it was ironic how he is on the field now instead of doing his hard homework like Mr. Leonard did. They both had a hard time getting through school and Mr. Leonard found something that he was good at but no one wanted a person that couldn't read and write. It was a lesson for Paul that he proabably considered. Paul also did a great thing and wanted to help Mr. Leonard.
22937	8	The background information helps Paul realize that just because he is in a remmedial class he can still be sucessful but, his school work is important to. Because of the fact that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, even though he was a track star.
22938	8	In the story Mr. Leonard helps Paul become so good at hurdles that he gained enough confidence in himself that he decided to join the track team.  Paul realizes that like Mr. Leonard helped him to over come the hurdles and get better at the sport, he could also do somthing for Mr. Leonard; Paul could help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22939	8	The background information has a big effect on Paul.  Paul can not read nor can he play sports.  Later on in the story Paul finds out Mr. Leonard was a record breaking hurdle college freshman, but he flunked out because he could not read.       In the story Mr. Leonard first helps Paul to become good at hurdles which will help him overcome things in his life. Later Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read which Paul can not either but has the privilage of having a learning center.     In the end of the story Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels and wants to help him, so Paul takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him learn how to read.
22940	8	We just know that paul can not read very good. We also find out that he is in sports.
22941	8	The effect the backround Informataion has on paul is a profound one. It causes paul to be able to relate to Mr. Leonard at a better levle becaue he had strugled with mutch the same thing that paul was strugling with now. Paul is also very empathedic, when he says in the end of the story, its time to start traing. This shows that paul wants to give back to the parson who helped him out.
22942	8	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard helped him understand that he is not the only one who had trouble reading. This made Paul feel connected to Mr. Leonard.'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me.' They both had trouble in school but even though Mr. Leonard had trouble he still made an effort to help Paul, and this encouraged Paul to help him.
22943	8	Mr. Leonard was a track star he broke records for 400 meter hurdles at the nationals but he was not very good at reading. School for him was very hard he had to ask his friends for help. Paul is similar to Mr. Leonard he has hard times at reading but pretty good at sports
22944	8	It makes him want to become a better runner. It also makes him more curious as to why Mr. Leonard never told him about his college running days. It also made the narrator want to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.     The narrator asked Mr. Leonard about the printout. The narrator tells Mr. Leonard that it was time to start his training.
22945	8	It had an effect making Paul want to Help Mr. Leonard train so he could go  for college and do better than he had done last time. It worried him a little bit so he  thought he could do his best at training Mr. Leonard.
22946	8	The feelings were familiar with Paul. So, he felt the need to help Mr. Leonard read since Mr. Leonard had given his time to help Paul excel at something.
22947	8	Paul is very curious as to why Mr. Leonard never told him though he had been training him. This effected Paul after Mr. Leonard told him his story because he is in the same position in his life. I think that it would make him want to be better.
22948	8	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star. He was surprised and wondered why he never told him and why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do the hurtles. As Paul asked about it, he also found out that Mr. Leonard can not read. Paul knew what it was like at that and wanted to help him with his reading since he helped him with the hurdles.
22949	8	Paul didn't know anything about Mr. Leonard except who he was and what he looked like and what he did at the school. When Mr. Leonard told Paul to follow him and jump some hurdles, he said show up the next day with shoes and shorts. Then the coach asked Paul if he wants to be on the team and asked who trained him. The coach then gave Paul a URL to look up and a name to look up. Mr. Leonard had been a record breaking track runner but he couldn't do the work because it was too hard for him. Paul found out and he was surprised. He confronted Mr. Leonard about it and then they talked about why he dropped out. Paul seemed very interested and still shocked. But it motivated Paul to do some work and try and do good with the sport.
22950	8	he learned that when Mr. Leonard was in school as a fresman he was a good athletic and that he had won the 400 meter hurdles. in paragraph 42 is tell you how he was an good athlete but he thought he wasnt good enough. it also tells how they didnt have a learning center like him that Leonard had to rely on friends to help him get by. But the again Leonard still had trouble with his work.
22951	8	He understands what he went through. The narrator has trouble with reading also. The narrator says, ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This proves that he knows what Mr. Leonard feels like, not being able to read.
25349	9	The author starts out with a strong introduction that captures the readers attention, and then the writer organizes the rest of the essay into subtopics. This makes it easy for the reader to know what he or she is reading about and it also helps the reader go back into the essay and find information very easily.

By stating what seems to be an unordinary thing, the author then explains that it's not so unordinary; It's real. After this gripping introduction, the author describes what space junk is to get the audience informed on the matter at hand. The author then describes an example of space junk causing a problem in the solar system. The author does this to inform the audience of the severity of the problem. To further explain the severity, the author goes on to describe how the little bits of debris are a big problem. This concludes the author's article and makes the audience more aware of the issue.
25471	9	The author organizes it by the big to smaller problems.Such as the junk that goes into orbit.and the smaller junk which poses problems to ships.
25472	9	They organize it very well. They start off with an attention grabber. Then they go on to tell information about the spce junk.
25473	9	He has sub-headings for each papragraph that starts a new topic.
25474	9	The author starts out with plenty of informmation to show the reader what the article is about and then displays important information to the readers to bring about the important problem.
25475	9	The author organizes the article by comparing and contrasting the facts about the information. Orbiting Junk is about junk in space while its floating in the air and falling into the Earth.
25476	9	The author organizes this article by telling us what the problem is, and how it can cause a threat. The author starts off by telling us a little bit of history about how space junk started.They then goes into the dangers of space junk. They do this by, first, telling us a story about how two satalites collided, which cause a bunch of tiny debris. Then, a story about how objects smaller than a baseball cannot be decteted, but can cause a lot of damage to a space shuttle. That is how the author organized this article.
25477	9	The author organizes the article in sections. The author starts out informing the reader about what space junk really is. Then he goes on to tell more about recent events that have posed serious concerns about space junk. The author then goes into further explanation of why the size of space junk is a serious problem. The information builds on each other to deeply inform the audience of why space junk is a concern.
25478	9	The author organizes the article in a way to split up the passage to make it easier to follow and to comprehend. The author splits up major points and then gives general information about the topic.
25479	9	to make it easyer to read and amke it more interesting as you read.
25480	9	The author organizes the article by sections. The first one is What is Space Junk? then Crash Course, then Little bits, but a big deal. It is seperated into categories. Easy for a person to find information about a certain thing.
25481	9	he poots a title at the top of each artlck.
25482	9	The author first explains what the problem is. Then he he shows us the history of space junk and how it came to be. The he says how space junk can affect our lives because of incidents like the satellites crashing into each other. Then he says how people do care what is up in space and how they are trying to get rid of the junk.
25483	9	It starts with the start of space exploration and tell more and more in each article until it leads up to the fact that the amount of space trash is still increasing and we need to do something about it.
25484	9	The author organizes this article by building on what he has stated in the previous paragraphs.  He also makes it more aparent in the later paragraphs how harmful 'space junk' is to the earth's surface and what kinds of problems it poses for astronuats.
25485	9	He/She puts subtitles to show the different problems of space junk and what it is and does.
25486	9	The author organizes the article very well. At one point he will talk about satellites, then he will then talk about microdebris. This article has a lot of information in it, and I have learned a lot. The introduction grabbed my attention right away, very enthusiastic.
25487	9	The author starts out with his introduction and then goes into his facts and details to gat his point across.
25488	9	The author breaks down the article into different parts. For an example: 'Crash Course' talks about how 2 satellites crashed into each other.      The author also asks questions in his articles, which in my personal opinon i like because it sets the tone for the story.     Finnaly, it makes this article look more interesting instead of it being all one article, breaking it up in several mini sections.
25489	9	He trys to make it like how difficult its gotten to go through space and how much parts and pieces thier is up there.
25490	9	The author uses a P 0 to open his first paragraph. He is trying to ingage the reader in the story. He also breaks the information down into different sections.
25491	9	The author organizes the article by having 'What is Space Junk' to go more detailed in paragraphs as the article went on like 'Crash Course' to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
25492	9	He starts off with something that grabbed my attention and closer to the end i got more interested. they author did a good job keeping me interested and he was very presestant on the topic, he never got off track.
25493	9	I think the author organize's the story buy telling you some thing  explaning to you what it is and helping you understand what it s to giving you fact's about what it is telling you certen events that have happen to why it is happing and what is the case and effect.
25494	9	The author organises it by asking questions, then giving you an answer. Plus telling other facts about 'space junk'.
25495	9	The author provides the history of each passage to inform the reader of how the space collison will occur, or collide.
25496	9	The author organized the article from what happens first and the importance. The author wants to convice the readers about the serious matter of Space Junk.
25497	9	The author arranges this article in a very organized way. First, he/she uses an exclamatory attention getter. In the second paragraph, the author switches gears and gives background information on how the space junk really becomes junk. Next, the author talks about a couple different examples of space crashes that have occurred, like the crash between an American communication satellite and a Russian one as well. In the end, the author talks about how important it is that the space junk is taken care of. He/she goes on to explain that the particles in space might be small but they can still cause significant damage because of the speed they are moving at. The author organizes the article in a way that can convince the reader that space junk needs to be removed before more damage is done.
25498	9	The author organizes it in a cause and effect sort of way. He introduces something called space junk. He explains what space junk is. Once the readers know what space junk is, he explains the problem with it. When the readers know the problem, he explains that scientists are searching for a simple solution to space junk.
25499	9	The author organizes this article, starting off with a few attention grabbing sentences that really stand out. Then the author goes into telling the reader, 'What IS Space Junk?' He informs us a lot about space crafts and telescopes and satellites. The author then starts telling the reader about crash courses and what to look out for in space while driving a space craft, such as the bits of debris. 'Those bits os space debris present a very serious problem.'
25500	9	The author sections out their paper with headings that have to do with the content, it looks good. it is also organized in such a way to make finding thiings alot easier.
25501	9	The author starts the article with a suprising and attention getting statement. Then he begins explaining the start of space exploration and the invention of satellites. Many spacecraft have been sent to outer space over the past 52 years, and though they are important to the discovery of what is beyond Earth, it can be very dangerous and develop a problem.      The action of sending spacecraft into space can cause some spacecraft to collide with other spacecraft. These small fragments of the spacecraft can collide with Earth and spacecraft, and can cause severe damage despite their size.
25502	9	The articlicle 'Orbiting Junk,' is orgamized by introduction, fact, hooks and a conclusion. It first gives a hook for the reader, line 2 of paragraph and in the next section it provides you with information on he topic at hand which is orbititing space junk. Then from there on out you are presented with startling statistics about space junk, which is harmful to our obiting system in many ways.
25503	9	He goes from getting the readers' attention to history to facts. Different paragraphs signify greater attentions in a multifactual essay. It is organized in a way that anyone can be interested and understand 'Space Junk.'
25504	9	The author starts out with exclamatory sentences. After that, the author states all of the improtant facts about space junk and satellites. Then he talks about the collisons of objects in space that create a 'crash course'.
25505	9	he seperates the article into different paragraphs.
25506	9	The author organizes the article in essay style, to keep the specific subjects sepperate.
25507	9	The author organizes this article by something to grab my attention. Then some intersting facts The rest was pretty boring.
25508	9	The author organizes this article by splitting up information into different groups. The author did a good job by organizing this article into groups of 'Orbiting Junk', 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The author could of just put all the information in the four articles into one big article, but the author wrote headlines, supported and wrote about her headlines and moved on to his or her next bit of information.
25509	9	The author starts with an attention grabbing introduction, then describes what space junk is, then how space junk can be formed, and finally how dangerous it can be.  I know this because in the paragraph after the introduction it tells about all the different types of things that can be space debre.  Then in the paragraph after that it tells about how satellites can crash into each other causing debre or a space man losing his tools causing debre.  Finally the last paragraph describes how space debre can punch holes in a craft or make it hard for a space ship to maneuver through a debre field.
25510	9	He starts off by grabbing the readers attention with exclamation marks. Then he gets down to serious business explaining that space junk is a serious problem. He also explain how the debris can cause satellite collisions and how tiny particles of debris can be a big deal.
25511	9	The author organizes the article first by introducing it which is a necessary for the reader to understand what the paper will be about, he titles sections and for the introducing section's title he put 'Orbiting Junk' to inform the reader of what that specific section will be about. The next section is titled 'What Is Space Junk?' He goes into explanations of what it is in said section. The section labeled 'Crash Course' explains what happens when no one is controlling an object. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' conludes the article and informs the reader of why Space Junk poses a threat and how the problem is worsening.
25512	9	The author organized the article in different sections.  He first had his introduction.  The article had a section where he talked about the history of space exploration and what 'space junk' really is.  Then, in the 'Crash Course' section the author wrote about the collisions in space that are causing the debris.  Finally, the artivle talked about the serious problems that the little debris can cause.  This section is informing us to be more aware of the dangers it can cause.  The author broke this into sections from least important to the most important.
25513	9	I think the author organized this article in a way that the reader gets roped into it at the beginning with the tone changing part of the way into it. It shows the serious matter of so called 'space junk'
25514	9	This article explains the complication of flying satelites up in space. It goes from information to
25515	9	the author organizes the article with good and understandible tittle that relate to the text that is being talked about and by adding alot of information and facts about space junk.
25516	9	The author organizes the article in the best way i think possible he makes it clear what the important parts are and how important sattelites are. In the introduction the author uses dialog to reel the reader in and to make them want to read more. In the section What Is Space Junk he describes in detail what space junk is. In the section Little Bits, But a Big Deal he tells the reader how dangerous space junk can actually be to spacecraft.
25517	9	How the auther organize this article is by telling us that space junk can be a big problem on space. The need to do many things to help the space by not having junk because thay want to impove satellite missions. Then they had crash course it is telling us that with no controls that it can risk collodinding with one other. Than they tell us it was big deal, they want us to see that outer space is a very important place and we need to help it. The article was just explaning how we need to improve the outer space by doing all we need to do.
25518	9	He puts it in a way it lets the reader see the information more clearly. He puts it in paragraghs of importance and what there is.
25519	9	Th author organizes the article in various sections. Starting first with an introduction, then onto various subtopics, defining space junk, space collisions, and etc., about the main topic 'Orbiting Junk'. It then ends with a proper conclusion.
25520	9	The author organizes his article by sections. He starts out with an intro, and telling what 'space junk' really is. Next, he goes on to tell about how debris gets into space. Then, he stresses the importantance and dangers of the 'space junk'
25521	9	With bolded titles from different sections of what the Author is about to tell us.
25522	9	The author orgnaize the article three parts and named eachstatements.The intro duction is talk about space junk but we don't know what it is.First one is 'what is space junk'it explain what is space junk and why space junk was appear.Second is 'crash Course'It explain crush about two satellites and how danger it was.Third is 'little bits, but a big deal'It explain small bits about it's danger in the space.And have to find solution.
25523	9	He makes it easier for the reader to understant in what order it happens in.
25524	9	The author organizes the article through the use of subsections. They organize like things into the same subsections. some subsections that are used include 'What Is Space Junk?' and 'Crash Course.'  These subsections allow the author to order the article in the correct way. The topics in the article go from space debris to how space debris comes about to the dangers of space debris.
25525	9	The author organizes this article in sort of a chronological type way. For example, the first part of the article ends with 'space junk', the next part begins with what is space junk. Then he ends the paragraph with 'disabled object[s]' and begins the next paragraph with 'dead satellites.' When he ends a paragraph, he ends with something to lead to another topic.
25526	9	The author organizes the article very well. The article is started off by grabbing your attention, and then revealing some important information to give you a little insight on what is to be talked about. The author goes on to speak of the basic history of spacecraft and what exactly space junk is. This informs the reader to build up for later information. Facts about collisions of satellites are later discussed, which is getting deeper into the topic. It is mentioned that any object can become free-orbiting satellites and transitions into how the tiniest object can make the biggest difference. The author sums up the article with more statistics on space junk and informs the reader on the status of the problem and how it has been looked at.
25527	9	The author introduces the topic. The author lets you know what the article will consist of. Then, provides a brief history of the information. Next, tells what his/her opinion is, and what could possibly happen in the future. Finally, the author states that something needs to be done to fix the problem.
25528	9	Startes off with an introduction that gets people thinking about what is in space and what is going to happen. Then explains what that 'junk' is. Thirdly, shows what could happen, did happen, in space. Lastly, a few facts what happens when things are different in space than on Earth.
25529	9	The author organizes the artice in a way that makes it easy for the reader understand just what they are obtaining. They put the contents of the passage in order so that you can understand what you will read in the next section. You learn one things so that you can understand something else. The author splits the article up into three different sections. They are written in the order of the least important to the most important.
25530	9	The authror explains what happens, and how it is caused.
25531	9	The author organizes the article in a very orderly fashion. First, there is an introduction the catch the reader's attention and get them interested in the article. It gives the reader an idea of what the article is about. It then talks about the first satellite which was launched in 1957. It goes on to talk about what the satellites do and things that can happen with them. The dead satellites have a risk of colliding with each other which can cause major problems. It just creates more debris. Then the article tells the reader about how the speed of space debris can cause major damage. Astronauts have to be very careful when taking things into space to prevent adding to the space debris. The article doesn't jump around, so that keeps the reader interested.
25532	9	The author goes aboat getting tour attention and then he gives you the evidence that space junk is dangerous.
25533	9	The author organizes this artical by his thoughts or in the order he thinks is right. He starts off with an introduction then explains space junk, the crash course, and finally little bits but a big deal. So therefor he organized this artical by what he thought would be interesting for us readers.
25534	9	The author organizes the article into sub headings. Each subheading gives the reader an idea of what the section is about. For example, the subheading 'Crash Course' preludes the information abut satellites colliding. Then within each subheading are paragraphs with the information.
25535	9	The way the author organizes the article is by seperating the information into different sections, by the information that was collected. For example, the different information they collected was history about the first artificial satellite that was launched, crash courses of satellites, and the after effects when the launch takes place.
25536	9	The articles is organized in 5 sections. It has the introduction, the 3 body sections with titles like 'What Is Space junk,' and then a conclusion. The author begins the article by starting off in a not very serious tone with his statements in sentences 1 and 2, to grab the reader's attention. Then he makes it much more serious of a subject. He informs us of the problem that he will be addressing in later paragraphs in paragraph 3 by telling us what space junk actually is. In the section 'What Is Space Junk,' the author gives us some information about the history of space travel, and then he tells us the problem of space pollution. In the next section, the author tells us about one of the more recent problems with space junk. Two sattelites collided in mid space in 2009 and as a result, more space pollution has occured. in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' a comparision is made between the space junk and a sandblaster to illustrate that even though very small, the space junk can be very harmful. In the conclusion, we learn that the amount of space junk is increasing because of an increase in commercial space travel, and that nations and corporations that take part in space travel in to come together to fix the growing problem.
25537	9	He organizes it into sections or chapters of different information of the main topic which is orbiting junk.
25538	9	The author organizes the article eith an attention getting intro. then the article gets serious on telling us how dangerous that space junk is. Then, it tells us how they can crach into each other in the future causing problems in space.
25539	9	The author organizes his articles by puttingthem into sections. If each sections talks about something different and goes into detail.
25540	9	The author organizes the article in a very useful way, by titleing each section on what it is about.
25541	9	By telling us the bad of space junk and what it can do to satellites.
25542	9	The author organizes the article by the most imporant to the least important statments.
25543	9	The author organizes the artical in various sections with titles that provide a clue to what the paragraph contains. For example, the title 'Crash Course' hints that the paragraph is about a crash in space resulting in space pollution.
25544	9	He first grabs your attenchen in the very begining. He starts to decsribe what space junk. He has the facts from many years a go. The author organizes his thoughts on space junk. He explanes how dangerous it can be. The author has lots of detailed information on space junk. He  wants to get it clear that space can be dangerous for astronots. The author tells what they are doing to improve space suttles and there space suits.
25545	9	It's started off with and attention grabbing introduction asking us a question, followed by a brief history giving us an understanding of space junk telling us how its a problem. Finally stressing the dangers and extremety of space junk talking about crashes, and how even small pieces can cause large amounts of damage.
25546	9	In the first selection it gets your attention by using exclamitory sentences. The second selection explains what you find in space. You are told about what space junk is and how it got there. Next, in the third selection, the author tells you about the dangers of space junk and gives you an example of what can happen. The finale selection summarizes what has been talked about in the other selections. It also tells you that space junk is a major problem that NASA and other space agencies are working on.
25547	9	The author organizes the article in the order of events that take place. The author tells about the first satellites, capsules, and telescopes that were launched into space. Then, the author gives all of the information about space junk. The reader learns what is is, and how it collides to make even more. Finally, the author starts discussing solutions and what scientists are doing to help solve the problem. Although scientists are trying, there are very little advances in finding a solution.
25548	9	He starts of talking about items they use to see in space. Then he starts talking about dead sattelites. He also talks about the problem thear is certain to persist. the amount of space trash increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.
25549	9	The author organizes the article by first giving personal quoetes and inputs. The he continues to give facts to support his points that he is trying to make throughout the article. He splits his paragraphs into split topics so he makes sure he hits each specific detail.
25550	9	He defines what space junk is. He then tells what it is doing and how dangerous it is. Then he tells us why people should care and many people do.
25551	9	The author organized this article in three different sections. In the first section he talks about, 'What Is Space Junk?' This paragraph talks about the historical event of the Soviet Union and the United States great space invasion. In paragraph two the author gives information about the 'Crash Course.' The article reads, ' With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other. That is excatly what happend in Febuary 2009.' That was when the American and Russians crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth. Last but not least, section three talks about how the space trash effects us on earth. In the text it says,'many people do care about the trash and find it as a problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.
25552	9	That space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.
25553	9	The author organizes this article by order of importance.
25554	9	In this article the author organizes their information in a way to help the reader understand. The author starts out simple but then continues to add on information as the article goes on. The article is split up into four different sections. The first is the introduction, grasping the readers attention. The second is defining 'space junk' so that the reader understands more with what's to be further explained. The third is explaining the problem with satellite crashes and space junk crashes. Lastly the fourth is applying emphasis on how big of a deal this problem really is and how it could effect us.
25555	9	Well first he gives you information. Then the author persuades you of the troubles. Then he backs up his information. After that he tells us what the harm could do to us.
25556	9	He tried to make an interesting introduction to grab our attention and make us wanting to read more of his article. Then he went on to desribe what his topic was and about the space junk with details. His next topic was about the crashing course of the space junk and listed some crashes such as 2008 a tool bag escaped into the orbit. Then to end his article he went on describe the space junk and what it can to do to harm space. He concluded with the nations can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.
25557	9	the author gives the intro and them dscrides and explains what makes up space junk. then he tells the reasons of why its their and reasons for it.
25558	9	The author organized this article in a logical order.  The author starts with the introduction, moves into describing what 'space junk' is, explains what happens when satellites collide, and eventually tells why all the small debris is very dangerous.  The author has these topics listed under three main topics: 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
25559	9	to mske the raeder understand how important space junk is and how it can effedt the world
25560	9	The author organizes the article in differant paragraphs to show different parts of space junk. like in the paragraph, {What is Space Junk} he talks about what it actually is.
25561	9	The author organizes the article by putting some humor in the introduction to make it interesting, then switching to explaining what has happened in the past. First he tells us what space junk is, and explains the how they can be harmful. Then he tells us that satellites have crashed into each other creating space junk. Then in 'Litle Bits, But a Big Deal' he explains that even the smallest piece of space junk can be seriously harmful if it comes to the Earth's surface.
25562	9	This author organizes the article in a very good way. He starts out with a little quote said by two people, which is re-stated in the article. He then goes to defining what Space Junk really is. He tells what it is, how it got there, and what it does up there. He then goes into saying how they run into each other, and then states how dangerous is can be.
25563	9	The author starts out with an introduction that grabs your attention. Then the author goes int othe history of spacecraft satellites, then modern day satellites, and then what happens when they crash. The author is starting out in the past and moving to the future with the article 'Crash Course.' The author wants you to know that their are still accedents that happen today even with our technology and also even in space.
25564	9	The author starts off with a very good attention getter. For example, when he said 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a.... tool bag? Then the author took a more serious matter and started to explain the dangers of space junk and started throwing out lots of facts/statistics.
25565	9	The author organizes the article by, going into detail explaining how dangerous most things are in outerspace. They say in paragraph 7 'that in 2008, a tool bag escaoed from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs on the International Space Station.'     They say, 'dead satelllites run the risk of colliding with each other', that is excatly what happend in February 2009. 'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft,' they say that in paragraph 9.
25566	9	The author begins this passage by grabbing the reader attention. Although the title 'Orbiting Junk' is humorous, the article is not at all. The title is a different way to grab the attention of the reader. After the introduction and the 'attention grabbing' the author talks about things that is very serious around our 'home'. Next, the article states that 'Two communication satellites, on American and one Russian, both travelign at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above Earth.' Which would be interesting to read if someone didn't know about it. Last, they talk about things that the reader can relate to like a baseball.
25567	9	In catagories.1. What is Junk2. Crash Courseand 3. Little Bits, But a Big Deal
25568	9	At first glance this article seems to have a simple layout of an introduction, and 3 topics. But if you investigate further you will see that after the introduction, is a topic that follows up on something mentioned in the introduction. And as the 'What Is Space Junk' section closes with the mention of free-floating satellites in space, it opens with a section about these satellites colliding. I am very entrigued by this way of organizing thoughts.
25569	9	The author organize it from just things in space, as in debris. Also with the crash that happen in 2009, bewteen Americans and the Russian.
25570	9	The author begins the article with a catchy, fun introduction and then introduces his concerns about 'space junk'. Next, in 'What Is Space Junk?', the author explains how space junk comes to be orbitting outer space. In 'Crash Course', he brings up the problem of dead sattelites colliding with each other, using an example. Then he talks about the little bits of debris created from these collisions in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. He explains how these littles pieces can cause serious damage, but cannot be detected because of their small size. He concludes the article with the fact that this problem is going to persist and something must be done about it.
25571	9	The author organizes the article by using an attention grabber at the beginning.  He then proceeds to define space junk and show how humans have created it 'Over the past 52 years. . .' with a brief history.(Paragraph 4)  The author explains that free floating debris crahses, disintegrates, and creates new, smaller space debris. Finally, the author explains that this microdebris is causing major problems in space exploration because of the size and the speed at which it travels.  The author uses a grain of sand traveling at 5 miles per second compared to a grain of sand in a gently breeze to show the dramatic effects that microdebris can have on a spacecraft, satelite, or astronaut.  The author uses an effective organization of getting the reader interested, informing them briefly of the topic, and then to get the reader thinking about the topic.
25572	9	The author orgainizes it by catagorys and seperating the different parts of the story.
25573	9	The author starts the article with the definition of space junk. The author writes about the history of space junk, and how it has become a problem. The author then goes on to talk about how space junk has now become a problem because many satelites are running into each other, and becoming free floating objects in space. Lastly, the author talks about how people care about this growing problem, and the ways in which it is trying to be fixed.
25574	9	The author organizes the article by seperating each of hismajor points in to sections with titles. For example, the definition of space junk is explained in 'What Is Space Junk?' and the problem with space junk is explained in 'Crash Course'. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' explains the gravity of the situation and proves that even the smallest bit of junk is harmful, let alone huge satellites.
25575	9	The author organizes the article in sections. It starts out with an introduction which just describes how the 'space junk' can do to our Earth. Then it goes into three other sections that explain what it is, what causes it, and why it is a huge concern.
25576	9	The author clearly separates this article into different categories that helps the reader to better understand the content. For example, the title 'Orbiting Junk' explains what the article is generally about. From the second title 'What is Space Junk?', we can conclude that the author is going to describe just what space junk actually is. From the third and fourth titles we know that the author is going to tell us one of the main factors that causes debris in space and how much of a threat it actually is. The author separates the article into small yet detailed sections so that the reader can better understand the content within it.
25577	9	By putting them into sections. Like Space junk to Crash Course and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. The author put them in order just to show that they are a dangerous thing and that it's not just one little thing it's huge.          The Author is trying to show and tell you how space junk really is dangerous. It is not something to laugh at our make fun of. If we can't fit our spacecraft through the space junk then there is definetly something wrong.    We should not have that kind of problem there shouldn't be anything but maybe one or to satellites in space so we can have our news. we could have meterors and not know it because of all the junk.
25578	9	The author organizes the article by first catching our attention with an introduction, then making it serious by explaining what space junk is & how it is harming our Earth's atmosphere.
25579	9	The author organizes the article by making the paragraphs flow. First, it hooks you in with the exciting comments like 'Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!'. Those variety of sentences gets you enticed into the story already, and makes you want to keep reading. The next way,they include organization is by giving information on the issue of space junk. The title 'What Is Space Junk?' lets you know that you'll be learning more in depth about the topic. The third type is using facts and information to make the stories seem credible, and that the space junk is real. When they use the statistic 'Two communication satellites...both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' Thats at an alarming rate, and it makes the topic they are talkinga bout seems dangerous. Lastly, the author uses the strategy of opinions and loaded language to show how serious the issue of space junk is.
25580	9	It starts out as facts then turns into a realization of hramful objects in space start out as satellites.
25581	9	This author tells  you about one thing and then the next you know it opens up for the new paragraph about what else is harmful in the space and what has happened in space and what could be done.
25582	9	The author organizes this article by seporating the main ideas into their own sections
25583	9	My answer would be about space junk and what it is.
25584	9	by putting it a god order. it was laid out neetly and well organized.
25585	9	first, from the beginning the author bring up some question to attract reader attention, then he started to explain and define the term of the question and some information after that he provide some examples with different subtitle, and also tell us the effect and reason of those example, finally he conclusion his question's answer again from the 1st paragraph.
25586	9	By telling wht to do with trash.
25587	9	He organizes each and every section, by how they are created and what went down when the United States and the Soviet Union was in the cold war.  The author wants us to know how space crafs are used and why they are used in planet we call 'Earth' today.
25588	9	The author organized this artical almost like a news paper. He starts with a great introduction about things that grabbed the readers attention and motivation to finish this artical. After that he starts the body of the artical and tells the reader about the past of space exploration. Next, the author tells the reader about two satellites coliding into eachother 491 miles away from earth. Then, the author tells the reader about the problem of microdebris and how it can effect future explorations in space. Finaly, the author concludes his artical and seriously tells the reader about the increasing problem with space debris.
25589	9	He narrows down about how spacejunk gets into space, and how small and painful microdebris can be.
25590	9	At first he comes out and makes it sound very interesting and trys pulling the reader in.  Then he goes into more detail telling you what are the down falls of the junk in space.  He also tells you about how all of the little bits can make a huge deal.  The pieces may be small but can do a lot of damage.
25591	9	From when it started the space traveling to up to date  exporation
25592	9	The author separates the article into three small sections each with their own titles. The author does this so if the reader is looking for specific information he can look at the titles to find certain things.The first sentance of the entire article shows the author is all about catching the readers attention. The separation of topics into their own titled sections is also a way to catch the readers attention.
25593	9	He starts with exciting statements. Then goes into a serious tone into space junk to get into the history of the space race. This leads into sputnik and the Americans launching their own satillite. This goesd on for years. Then it goes on to mention that all these satillites add to the danger of coolisions creating debris. This mentions two events, one in 2009 where an American and a Russian satillite collided creating debris and an astronaut loosing a tool belt in 2008. This leads into that even small debris is harmful. That even little grains can damage a spacecraft at great speeds. This adds to the danger when launching into space.
25594	9	The author organizes the article by first telling the subjects history, then, how dangers it could be, and finally, how serious the matter really is. Ex. Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Ex. With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with eachother. Ex. Tiny fragments traveling at the speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.
25595	9	The author organizes this article by breaking it up into different sections. These sections are paragraphs that have to do with with one topic.
25596	9	orbiting junk-startaling statments,What is space Junk-statisticses,Crash course-what could happen and what did happen ;two sattalites at more than 20,000 miles per hour crashed into eachother,Littel bits,but a big deal-peoples opineiouns what scientists are going to do about it Yet the problem is certain to persist.
25597	9	It is organized by showing what the objects in space are and what they can do to satillites revolving and how they might be dameged do to objects not needed in the gravitational pull of the earth.
25598	9	The author organizes the article in a series of headings and sub paragraphs.
25599	9	The author organizes this article by talking about the dangers of space junk and describes the possible outcomes from it. After it talks about space junk, it talks about how things like this have really happened. In February 2009, two communications satellites were both traveling at 20,000 miles per hour and crashed into each other, which created hundreds of pieces of debris. That created hundreds of microsatellites flying through space. In the very last section; Little Bits, But a Big Deal, that talks about how people could think that it's not such a huge deal, but alot of people actually do.
25600	9	The author organizes the article into three categories:  What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.  What Is Space Junk? defines what space junk is.  Crash Course explains how dangerous space junk can be.  Little Bits, But a Big Deal explains that many people are concerned about space junk and that it is a big deal.
25601	9	The author organizes the article very well. In the begging he or she start out with just a few sentences to grab your atttention before they start to address the larger matter. Then he or she move on to what is space junk and go back in time to explain how space junk became, dateing all the way back to 1957, during the Soviet Union.      After telling about space junk over 50 years ago then he or she goes into telling about how dangerous space junk can really be. Also he or she go into deatail towards the end about how even the tiniest junk floating around in space can make a tremindous disaster to a space craft or earth.     Overall i would have to say that he or she did and amazing job of organizing the right information and kept the article flowing from one deatil to the other.
25602	9	The author uses startling statistics,he highlights the importance of sattellites,he supports his facts, and he graps the readers attention.
25603	9	it is good to know what some of the thing are before you read about them so they are in a good order.
25604	9	The author puts all of his information that he wants to share into three different sections throughout the story.
25605	9	It organizes it by telling what happened to the United States spaceship and to the russian's spaceship first. Then it tells about all of the debris that floats around in space and how it is bad for the space ships that are up there, because they can't see the debris because it said they can't see anything that is smaller than a baseball.
25606	9	The author tells the article of how harmful little bits of items in space will effect the world.
25607	9	The author organizes the article into four sections. They begin with an opening section that tells the reader what the article will discuss. Then the three other sections all have headings that give a general idea about what the few paragraphs will be about.
25608	9	The author of this article put the sections into the importance order. He/She wants people to understand what the article is talking about then explain what space debris is and what the importance of it is. The explains what happens when these satalites crash and how dangerous it can be to the earth.
25609	9	He organize the article by begining with simple information and then giving inportant facts and reasoning.
25610	9	The author of the article organized the article. By first making a hook then some history behind space exploration then they start with how space collisions happen and how they happen. They then end the article with how microdebris is harmful to the space craft that are needed to explore the galaxy and communication satellites.
25611	9	The Author of the Article 'Orbiting Junk' organized his information with bolded headings. He started in the Introduction by getting the reader interested. Next, he educated the reader on what he was talking about with the heading 'What Is Space Junk?'. Following this, he used the heading 'Crash Course' to provide an example of an incident. Lastly, the author concluded with the heading 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' to emphasize the impact that space junk has space safety.
25612	9	What he does is he will start off a different topic a different way. Like for example, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a...tool bag?'. Then the other times he uses a rhetorical question, a statistic, and random statements.
25613	9	He organized his article by starting off by grabbing the readers attention.  This would intrege the reader to continue reading his article.  But then, right before the next section they say something that a normal person reading the article would understand.  So in the next paragraph they would talk about it and explain it.  This is whay the author does throughout the whole article.  In the article it states, 'This 'space junk' is currently of great concern to government space agencies around the globe.'  However, someone off the side of the road wouldn't understand what space junk is.  So then the author goes into another section, that is even titled 'What Is Space Junk?' This allows the reader to fully understand what the author is trying to explain to the reader.  He organized his paper so that it doesn't seem to a reader that he is talking in another scientific language that seems difficult to understand.  It allows the reader to understand what the problem is.
25614	9	The author organizes this article by telling the facts from past years to todays society. From the beginign it starts out in the 1957 then goes to future dates.
25615	9	In the introduction the writer talks about how outer space os filled with clutter, and you could basically find anything. In the body he gives details and facts about the United States and spacecraft and such. In the conlusion paragraph the writer explains how things will never change, and what could possibly happen if they don't.
25616	9	The author organizes the article by breaking it down into sections.  Like by the introduction, the body paragraphs, and then the conclusion, instead of just putting all that information into one paragraph.  By doing that, it makes it much easier to read, and go back somewhere that you need to reread or something.
25617	9	Even in outer space, pollution is a serious problem.  Clutter and debris are hazardous to Earth as well as fellow astronauts.  Space corporations may probablly need to reconsider the construction of space equipment before launching.
25618	9	Well he organzie his article in to parts like telling people what to do and saying the observation. Then underneath it is the story what is space junk so he has him telling directions and then telling a story.
25619	9	The author starts out by using questions sort of in a funny way 'It's a .... tool bag?' (3). Next they go on decribing the problem 'What is Space Junk?' (9). Then they decribe the causes of it. Finally they explain how a little thing can cause so much damage.
25620	9	The author organizes the artical by putting each important fact in a catagory all its own. Take 'What is Space Junk' for example it explains what space junk is and how dangerous it cud be to the Earth. In the section titled 'Crash Course' it talks about the risks of dead satellites colliding with one another. In Feburary of 2009 2 communication satillites one American and one Russian collided with one another.
25621	9	The author organizes the article with headings. They are 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits But a Big Deal'. Within each of the headings the author also uses specific examples that relates to the heading it is under.
25622	9	The author tells you all about the space junk and what has happened to space in the year's. The author also explains everything to the reder so they know that the author is not just playing around this is a serious matter and the author want's the reader to understand that.     The author help's the reader in a way so that they understand how thing's got this way in first place which is a good thing because it make it easier for the reader to understand where the author is coming from .
25623	9	He organizes it from small and simple problems to big and complex conflicts.
25624	9	The author organized the imformation he gathered well. His intorduction paragraph obviously wanted to catch your attention and to draw his reader in. Secondly, he informed his reader about what exactly 'space junk' is. He taught me what happens to the satellites that stop working and gave me some history. In the third section 'Crash Course' I felt that he still gave me some history about the satellites. In the last section i felt that he the author scared me a little bit to help me become more aware of how dangerous it is to have floating things in space.
25625	9	This article is laid out by topical organization. This is evident because of the fact that there are four different labeled sections in the story, each for a different topic of the subject. For example the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?' explains what space junk is, while the section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' explains why people should be worried about space junk.
25626	9	The author organizes this article by first using a funny and catchy introduction to get the reader's attention and get them interested in the subject. As you read on though the author next uses statistics and facts and changes the tone from funny to serious, to indicate to the reader that even though we might not think about the space debris too much, that it poses a serious threat to humanity. He uses a specific story to show what he means, about when the two satellites crashed into each other. Then he goes through explaining why the space debris is so dangerous, and why its such a serious matter. He explains that even though the debris is small, that with high speeds they cause a lot of damage. He then describes what we are trying to do to solve and prevent more of the damage from happening, but at the end tells us how even though we know its dangerous, the space debris is still increasing and that we are still trying to come up with a solution for it.
25627	9	The author seperates out different problems of space debris, from what it actually is to how the remains from a crash create thousands of little pieces and this number of pieces is ever increasing. The author talks about how space junk first found its way in orbit during the dawn of space exploration over 50 years ago, how being so far from the earth's atmosphere keeps them from degrading which makes them last longer and therfore makes them more likely to be in a crash at some point.
25628	9	The author does a great job of organizing this article. They really set up the information well. They tell you about space junk, and they give you a background history on space exploration.
25629	9	The author organizes it by asking us questions at the beginning of the story, giving us facts in the introductions. Then it goes down to 'What Is Space Junk?' It explains that very well it quotes 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacrecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and sateelites, have been sent beyond Earth's telescopes.
25630	9	In sections, like the introduction, to the Little Bits, But a Big Deal
25631	9	Really good.
25632	9	The author puts questions in the first paragarghs and then answers them in complete thought and ideas.
25633	9	The author organizes his article very well. He made the article into different sections, so if you are just interested in one subject the you can just read that section. For example, if you are just interested in satellites crashing then you can just read 'Crash Course.'
25634	9	The author organizes the article, by first talking about what is space junk, then how they are dangerous, and what they do to cause damage.     The first part describes what space junk is and how it is formed in the atmosphere.  The second part is describing how it can become dangerous when pieces break off.  The third part is saying how they have caused damaged and how dangerous they really are.     In conclusion, this article is talking about what space junk is and how the government is concerned by it.
25635	9	The author defines what is considered space junk in the first section of the article. From there, the author explains what can happen with the junk that is floating around in the orbit. It is explained that the satellites can collide, making even smaller debris float in space. This small debris can cause a spacecraft to malfunction horribly. In the ending section of the article, the author states that even the tiniest pieces of debris can have a huge impact.
25636	9	The author organizes the article into three main sections and an introduction. The intorduction has a title aptly named 'Orbiting Junk' because the character finds a tool bag in space. The second two articles provide information. The article titled 'What Is Space Junk?' divulges background information on the subject to the reader. The third section tells what happpens to sattelites in space and how they are a problem. The fourth article tells what can be and what is being done to prevent and overcome this problem.
25637	9	The author organizes this article by putting the information in sections. Each section talks gives different information about space junk and space history. The author divides the information in three different catagories called What is Space Junk, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
25638	9	The author orginizes the article so that he drags the the readers into the article.
25639	9	He orginaizes it in telling about the history and the outcome of the accident.
25640	9	He starts the article with the basic introduction to tell what the article is about; such as  'Orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions.'     Then it is saying what causes the space junk and it's from satellites cooliding in space.      Then it tells about what the is the big deal with space junk and the dangers of it.
25641	9	The articles are organized by the satellite sections and the deberis that is caused in space. and the difficulties the debris puts on the satellites.
25642	9	The author introduces the article with giving an example of space junk. 'It's a . . .tool bag?' Then the author exlpains in further detail what exactly spae junk is. '...what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfunctions and can't be prepared? This object becomes a peice of high-tech junk...' Then the author goes on to  explain what can happen from the space junk in space. Lastly, the author tells us how the debris from the collisions can lead to very serious problems.
25643	9	The author organizes the article by having the general information first and then the explaination of how the debris can effect the Earth, how it effects us, and why this issue is around. In the artcile the author starts out with the general staement and then clearifies any questions about the main subject. Second the author tells us how the debri got there. Lastly the author tells us why it is harmful to the planet and us.
25644	9	The author organizes the article by putting the different topics into different sections. he titles one section ''What is Space Junk?
25645	9	He organizes the article into different sections so that you can find what your looking for easier.
25646	9	The author organized this article by using subheadings. He used the subheadings, 'What Is Space Junk?' 'Crash Course,' and, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The subheadings make it easier for the reader to find the information they are looking for. Under the subheading, 'What Is Space Junk?' one might find the definition of 'space junk.' '...what happens whan a satellite 'dies'...? The disabled object becomes a piece of hight-tch junk, cicling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.' This explains what space junk is and how it become 'space junk.' The subheading, 'Crash Course' mightemphasize what will happen if the space junk's orbits cross.'Two communication satellites...crahes into each other... Now instead of two disabled satelittes, there are hundres of microsatellites flying through space.' this explains what happens when the paths of disabled satellites cross. The subheading, 'Little Bits But a Big Deal,' might discuss hoe the microdebris can have a hrmful effect. '...the amount of space trash is actually increasing...'
25647	9	The author organizes his article in a very peculiar way.  It first starts with a great attention getter, showing what space junk is.  Then he talked about the history of the junk; why it is there.  Next he describes the crashes that can occur due to space junk.  He ended with what space junk is doing, and how harmful it really is.
25648	9	The author organizes his ideas by putting them into titled paragraphs.  Each subject does not flow so well together so he put them seperatley,  to emphaize each paragraph.
25649	9	That there is space junk all over the space and it could hurt the earth and the space centers in space.
25650	9	THE AUTHOR ORGANIZES THE THE ARTICLE VERY WELL IN MY OPINIION. THE AUTHOR TELLS WHAT GOES ON IN SPACE AND ALL KINDS OF DETAILS ABOUT IT.
25651	9	With new caption before every paragh.
25652	9	The author organizes the article by facts. He wrote his sub-titels and puts down the information needed to explain the heading.
25653	9	the author organize the article by the most important to the least important.he starts off with the biggest problem space junk and ends with little bits, but a big deal.he tells how the little bits of space debris is a serious problem but space junk is a much bigger problem.
25654	9	The author tell 'what is space junk?' He also gives more information about the satellites. He aslo meanchens about the crah course. In pargraph six meanches that when no one is at the controls the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other. The other idetail information was in pagraph eight 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'      That's talking about how it is a problem to the space program. Like in pargraph eleven saying, ' In fact, the amount of space trash is actullay increasing because commerical space travel is on the rise and more nations hace undertaken space exploration.' In pargraph 10 it also meanchen how the little things in space can be difficult for space craft.
25655	9	he does it very well.
25656	9	the author explains differently in many paragraphs how space junk can be a hazardous to the atmosphere.
25657	9	He organizes it by explaing the dangers held within space trash. In the first two articles he explains what space trash is and identifies that it is a huge problem.
25658	9	The author organizes the article into well-defined, titled sections, each describing the title in detail. One of the sections, called 'Crash Course', is a two-paragraph section on how satellites become debris. First, a paragraph on large satellites that collide to create tiny microsatellites. The next, a paragraph on less spectacular crashes. How astronauts may accidentally lose something in the great vaccum of space.
25659	9	The author starts his story with a anctodatol lead then the author talks about a problem. Explaines why this problem occures. Finialy tells what will happen in the future why it harms the earth and how this might effect us by saying that more satlights will hit each other and our orbit around earth will be clutered in the near future.
25660	9	He organized the article by using spasific titles for each paragraph he writes and includes information that is relivent to the title in each section of the titles.
25661	9	The author organizes the artical by telling what is in outer space and what can and has happened in outer space. The author Describes the danger and tells how it could hurt the earth.
25662	9	The article has an Introduction, some Background and History of space junk, then it talks about the problem of space junk and how it collides with each other, the it ends with the big Problem and how it should and could be fixed.
25663	9	The author organizes this article into mini chapters.  The chapters cover main topics that the author talks about most. The first chapter is called 'What is Space Junk?'.  The author then supports this rhetorical question with two paragraphs.  The second paragraph titled 'Crash Course', is also supported by two paragraphs.  The last paragraph, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', is supported by three paragraphs.
25664	9	The author organizes the article by first gettting you hooked. They catch your attention. Then the author introduces what the article is really about. Next it explains space travel and uses details to support the argument that this is a problem.
25665	9	The author organizes his article based on the severity of the matter. First he starts out explaining what exactly space junk is. Then he moves on to hint at the possiblity of debris crashing into important space objects, such as satellites. He finally puts more emphasis on the subject by sharing truths that have happened in the past and what could become of these flying 'invisible baseballs.'
25666	9	The author starts out by talking about how odd it is to see a tool bag in space just floating around. Then the author goes into explaining what space junk is. The author gives examples of what would be considered space junk. Then the author has a paragraph titled crash course. This paragraph is talking about how the satalites that are sent out into space are not controlled by anybody. They are just out there. The author also talks about how when the satalites crash into each other, how big of a deal that is. The satalites crashing into each other creates space junk. The author also has a paragraph titled Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This paragraph is talking about how people think that little space debris isnt as big of a deal as people make it out to be. The author gives an example of throwing sand at something or shooting it through a sandblaster and the difference in impact. This paragraph is pretty much telling you that it doesn't matter how big or small the debris is, it can still do alot of damage.
25667	9	The author organizes this article by what its about to what is it towhat can it do.
25668	9	HE put the different topics that people may want to know about in different sections of the story. Like seperating the information about satellites from space junk.
25669	9	The author organizes the article in a way that shows how satellites get to where they are, then what happens if they were to get disabled and collide, and finally the potential dangers it creates.
25670	9	He organizes the article by putting titles at the begining of a new section and that tells the reader that something else is about to happen. The subject is about to change and the auther does this by having titles. You do not see this very often you usually just see an indent to start a new pharagraph ,and a new idea. He starts it off really good and that draws the reader in and then he begins with all the facts and everything about space junk.
25671	9	He uses sub titles to organize the article.
25672	9	he breaks it down into categories of each specific branch of information
25673	9	He puts the enfurmation in order.
25674	9	The author starts off with an introduction from the readers point of view then the author give a little information about space junk and what its made from. The the author talks about why there is space junk.  The last paragrah talks about why space junk is dangerous and all the effects it could have.
25675	9	The author organized the article by using thing that the reader might actually intrest a preson.
25676	9	The author first has the introduction and his attention grabber, 'It's a...tool bag?'.  The next three sections, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' are all separated and organized by catagory of information.  For example, the section, 'What is Space Junk?', gives a background history of space junk but the section, 'Crash Course' is all about satalites crashing into one another.
25677	9	The author organizes the article by first grabbing your attention, and then giving you facts.
25678	9	he explains it in detail from begening to the end
25679	9	The author orginizes the article by having a introduction and a middle and an end.
25680	9	The author organized the article by different topics. The first paragraph is about a comet, but it really wasn't one it was just a tool bag. The next one was about what is space junk.Then the second to last topic was about that stuff we leave in space will come down and have a crash course toward earth. The last topic is little buts, but big deal something small from space can fall to earth and still leave a very big impact on earth.
25681	9	The author organizes the article in diffrent section. In the first part of the article the author explains what space junk is.  In the second part the author explains how the space junk got there.  In the last part of the article the author explains how the space junk is a problem and is dangerous.
25682	9	By creating smaller sections of the reading with catchy titles, the author makes the passage more direct on certain subjects.

Engaging the reader and keeping them engaged is sometimes a problem and with the different interesting titles the reader is constantly re-engaged.
25683	9	The author organizes in a way that builds up on the topic. First, the author talks about what is space junk and when it started. Second, the author gives information on when the space junk actually became a problem in the crashing of two satellites. Last, the author explains that litte things can have a big impact.
25684	9	The author had supported towards the fact because he had been to the spcaeship and flew to the moon and experenced the moon.
25685	9	he comes in week but finishes strong
25686	9	Ithink the arthor organized the article in order of inportance. I think he did this to build up to to show that little bits in space are offten over looked but they are lso inportant as any other things.
25687	9	The author organizes the information by starting with the main title, and then followed by subtitles to divide the information into different categories.
25688	9	He begins by explaining space junk and the history of it. Then he explains how dangerous all of the microdebris can be, considering there is very much of it around space. Crashes happen often. Finally, he explains how much people care about the debris and how its not just an ignored problem. It can cause serious damage.
25689	9	The author organizes the article in chronological order. They start each paragraph with a question and then they answer it in a well thought out paragraph putting things in an order that can be easily understood by the readers.
25690	9	He starts the article off by getting the reader's attention with a real scenerio. After he has the reader's attention, he changes the tone of the article to more a serious mood. He does this to emphasize the importance of the space junk. He first explains what space junk is, then explains the harm it can cause, then explains that even though it's small it is a serious matter.
25691	9	The author organize the article by dividing it into sections. First section is about Orbiting Junk. Secont is What Is Space Junk. The third is about the Crash Course. Lat but not least is the Little Bits, But a Big Deal .
25692	9	The author first grabs your attention with the interesting introduction. He then continues on to talk about satellite collisions to explain why some space junk exists. Then he shares some important facts about space debri and makes it evident that it is a serious matter.
25693	9	The author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is. Then the author goes on to tell us that crashes have happened and then explaining what a threat the space junk can be.
25694	9	The author organizes the article by assigning the information to its own section and giving the information a title. for example the title 'What is Space Junk?' gives information about all of the different 'junk' we send up into space, explains how it comes back to earth, and why this is so un-needed.
25695	9	In paragraph form with more than one headings.
25696	9	I personally think that it is a good article. The author has done a very good job. With using the history of NASA and others. Another thing I really like about it. Is there is a title for each new paragraph. To help the reader stay clear of confusion. And mushed together paragraphs. I also like the opening introduction to this little story.
25697	9	First the aurthor will give you information about why satalites went into space.  Then he will will lead into telling you how uncontrolled satalites are more likley to run into each other and when they do, a lot of debre is let out in space.  After that he explains how when astronauts go into space they should be super careful so they do not let any more debre go into space because is it not needed. Later he goes into how more space junk is actully increasing and he hopes corporations work together to help stop this.
25698	9	First he starts out with a small question to draw you in. Then he gives you facts about space junk and says how to fix it.
25699	9	The author begins with an exciting hook that makes you want to read more. 'Grab your telescope'... then he adds a sense of humor when he says 'It's a tool bag?' Then after his introduction he describes what space junk really is. Then he records the dangers of having 'space junk' or for example dead satellites floating around in space. They are at risk of colliding with eachother. He explains how after the crash, instead of 2 satleitles roaming around, there was now hundreds of peices of debris flying through space. To us we may not see the harm in 'little bits' flying around but he goes on to inform us on how it is a 'big deal'. Concluding with space trash being a serious issue.
25700	9	He give titles for all section of the article that us readers can follow most earse than a big summary of the Orbiting Junk in are space.
25701	9	The author titles each new section. There are four sections all together; including the introduction there are 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
25702	9	The author organizes the passage with three main topics in addition to the introduction. The author defines space junk, gives specific examples of it, and expresses potential danger it could bring. A specific example occured in 2009 when two fast moving satellites collided forcing hundreds of microdebris pieces into the gravitational pull of Earth.
25703	9	The author organizes the article by braking it down into small sections that to together help you fully understand the article.
25704	9	The author oranizes the article,'Orbiting Junk,'  in a specific way.  The author begins by grabbing the reader's attention with lines such as ,'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a ... tool bag?'The article goes on to describe what space junk actually is and the outcome it has on planet Earth.  Deeper in the article a reader can find examples of satellite crashes in the segment titled 'Crash Course.'  The author gives an example of when two communication satellites crashed into each other in February of 2009.  The author closes the article by describing that even the smallest of debris can make a difference in the solar system.
25705	9	the author organizes the article horribly
25706	9	The author organizes the article with
25707	9	He starts by showing some history of spce lanchs into space. Then he talks about that over time that satellites become junk that can make problems in space for satllites that are still good. And that we need to start beening more careful about we do down in Earth.
25708	9	The author organizes it by telling exactly what it is at the begining, by having one of the sections named 'What is Space Junk?' Then tells some issues about what damages space junk can cause in the section titled 'Crash Course'. Telling how all that junk got into outer space in the first place. Then the author finishes off with the section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This section talks about who cares about space junk, and how to prevent it.
25709	9	Starting with an introduction that explains personal statements. Then to explaining what the term space junk actually means. From statstics to many interesting facts it explains how it gets there, what happens to it, and how bad it is effecting space.
25710	9	The author starts with an introductory and then uses titles for different subjects the author is talking about. The author does this to better organize the article. Separating into different stories is easier and lets the reader understand what she is writing about before they read it.
25711	9	The author organizes the article by giving an early history of the first satallites, up to more of the modern day ones.  In the last paragraph it talks about space debris.
25712	9	The author oraganizes the article by putting different articles on diffrent pages and the layout has to be put a certain way and things have to be perfect. There cannot be any errors spelling mistake typos nothing like that. The paper is only allowed to be so many pages so there can't be any articles too long or there can't be too many.
25713	9	explains the history of space junk.

It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a .... tool bag?' This quote does do the job of grabbing the reader's attention because it's a very common catch phrase that he uses.     Next, the author describes just exactly what 'space junk' is by giving the history of space exploration within the human race. The paragraph is titled, 'What Is Space Junk?' He states how exactly the satellites and other objects because this junk, 'The obects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above the Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up. In this airless environment, some of them continue to circle the planet indefinitely.' This paragraph also explains that when a piece of 'high-tech junk' is disabled that it just orbits around the earth uncontrollably.     Within the next two paragraphs, the author gives different facts as to how the space junk is harmfull; 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles aboce the Eart. The impact created hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.' It goes on with describing the different dangers that these paths of debris cause.
25717	9	I think that the author organizes the article in order from most important to least important. Te author uses a lot of details in the beginning but not as many in the end. But the author definately uses a lot of details through the whole article.
25718	9	The author is building up on the importance as the article goes on. Starting with just saying there is space junk and ending with there is a lot of it and we can not see what is smaller than a base ball.
25719	9	the artical is starting with thelling us what space junk is. Then the artical is running the through the history. Finally it gets into the size and desine of it.
25720	9	The Orbital pathway around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions.
25721	9	The author organizes this article by splitting it into different sections.  The sections include: Orbiting Junk, What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.

25722	9	The author organizes the article into section that have diffrent perposes.
25723	9	The author arganizes the article by telling what the readers really don't know much about. Like what space junk is, and how does it effect things in space. Then it leads into how satellites really work
25724	9	He likes to split it up into section topics. Then the author just goes on and on with his story.
25725	9	He organizes it in a section form . He takes all the information that is related to eachother and splits it up into similar groups
25726	9	The author organizes this by giving you examples and descriptions on the reality of space. How just little pieces of space junk can jepidize a mission towards space.
25727	9	The author tells how space junk is a big deal. Then starts with how it gets to become space junk. Then the author talks of how we have to detect it and try to avoid it, and what problems occur because of it.
25728	9	This article is divided up into smaller sections to make it easier to read. Each section has a title such as 'Crash Course' to let the reader know what information will be presented in that section. There are so many different topics about Space Junk that the author covers in this article, such as how space junk got into space and how it can cause problems for spaceships, that breaking it up with the interesting titles was good organization by the author.
25729	9	He starts with a strong introduction that grabs the readers attention. He then begins to discuss different important facts about space. He tells the things that go on in space and the problems that occur. He also speaks on the opinions of people and how they actually care about space debris with it being a serios problem.

He then switches the tone of the article to more serious and informational. He categorizes information into three categories: 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The first category tells the reader about how 'space junk' is formed and what it consists of. Furthermore, the second category delves further into the topic of the magnitude of crashes between satellites orbiting the earth. Additionally, the third category informs the reader about why tiny particles in space orbiting the Earth are very dangerous. In sum, the author organizes the article in this fashion to help the reader understand the detriments to 'space junk.'
25731	9	The author organizes the article into individual, titled sections which each address a very specific aspect of space junk or further explain the issue it creates in the atmosphere. After the introduction, three sections sections follow, each of which consists of two to four paragraphs. 'What is Space Junk?' explains the concept of debris orbiting the earth in space and how it came to be. 'Crash Course' begins to explore the dangers of such debris. Lastly, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' emphasises the seriousness of the issue of space junk.
25732	9	First, the author explains to the reader what space junk is. Then, the example of the American and Russian satellite crashing is presented to show how the crashes create debris. Finally, the author goes into detail about how the space junk is very dangerous, and how many organizations are searching for a solution to the problem.
25733	9	The author organizes the article by introducing the topic, explaining its importance, and an providing supporting details. The passage informs the reader about space debris. Then, the author continues to give information about its dangers. Finally, they give examples of what various sizes and types of debris can damage or destroy. it also informs the reader of difficulties it can cause.
25734	9	The author draws you in with the introduction, then explains what space jumk is and how it has become a problem. The author also explains how space junk ended up in orbit in the first place. Then the author explains how dead satellites create even more space junk after they collide with another satellite or any other space junk freely orbiting the Eath. Lastly, the author explains how dangerous this space junk can really be and all the damage it could cause.
25735	9	the author went from small problems to big problems that hed more effect on us .The author started out with describing the what things were in space to what they could do while they are up there .
25736	9	The article has a catchy introduction.  It asks exciting questions to get the attention of the reader.  After the opening, the writer goes directly into the body of the paragrah, beginning with facts, definitions, explanations and details, such as space junk, what it causes, sizes, and similes comparing microdebris to sandblasters.  Towards the end, the writer explains how littering in space can cause great problems to orbiting spacecrafts.  The writer explains this by saying that little bits are a big deal.
25737	9	the author organized the article because many people do. Aslo so he did it because certain to persist can be a problem. Space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involve can work together to come up with a viable solution to space poolution
25738	9	The author organizes the article by making the introduction interesting then the important information about space. Using newer information and also using some space history which makes it more interesting knowing what space was like years ago and how it could be different now.
25739	9	the author organized it in 3 ways with difernt kinda stuff on every one
25740	9	The the author organized the artical by sub-topic. Every sub-topic has its own title, such as 'Crash Course' or 'Little bits, But a Big Deal'.
25741	9	The author organizes it in a special way. He Grabs your attention by putting exclamation points in. Then He asks questions and gives some facts. He states the problem and also gives more facts and examples.
25742	9	The author organizes the article by first getting the readers attention, then telling what the article is about, then telling about it.
25743	9	The author organized the article in a understandable way.

He introdused by being shoked so that the reader would get interersted on the article. He then continues with what his point means followed by facts that have happened in space. That way is understandable, and the reader do not gets confused.
25744	9	The author organizes the article by defining the term 'space junk', giving examples of serious situations that cause the junk, and last the author explains the consquences of the amount of trash in space.  According to the article, 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.'
25745	9	The author starts by drawing in the reader in his introduction. He then gives a history on what space junk is and how it got there. After that, he gives examples of how two different instances where space junk has been put out into space. He then uses his given information to sum up in the end of how space junk is effecting us and to emphasize that it is a big deal.
25746	9	The author starts out by trying to get us really intrested in the article with 'exciting' staements from people. Then he goes on about the confusing part of the tool bag and how people dont understand it being there. After that he goes into details about hor Space Junk is bad and how we should take extreame precaution to space junk and that it can be dangerous. next he tells us some of the accidents that have happened to space objects from space junk to help us get a better understanding on how bad space junk can be. Last, but not least, he tells us how space junk is INCREASING because of the commercial space travial and how we are doing more of it. He ends it by saying that we are just increasing spave pollution.
25747	9	The author organizes this article into sections. Each section has a different subject. The paragraphs are Orbiting Junk, What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big deal. These are ways to explain the different subjects.
25748	9	The authors starts out with an introduction and a definition of what space junk is. The author then tells us of ways that space junk is created and then finishes by talking about the effects and possible problems of the future.
25749	9	The author starts out in the beginning telling you how all of the space debris started to become what it is. The author then tells you how all of this poses a threat to everything that leaves earth atmosphere to go to another planet or to just work on a satellite.
25750	9	The author starts out by having a topic paragraph to interest the reader. Then he explains that many spacecrafts have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere. In 'Crash Course' he explains that spacecrafts can crash into each other and debris flying around. He then explains that even if the debris is small, it's still dangerous.
25751	9	The author organizes the article by describing the processes in which space junk can be harmful.
25752	9	The author organizes his thoughts very well. He has and introduction that gets the reader interested 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Not only does this start off getting you interested, but it also ends with a sort of puzzling statement. 'It's a . . . tool bag?' The he moves on to 'What IS Space Junk?' Here he moves onto describing, and defining what space junk is and how it can be deadly.
25753	9	He organizes it by spreading the different topics. First he was talking about orbiting junk, then he was talking about, like what is space junk and other stuff like that.
25754	9	The author organizes the article in the best way that he can to inform you about space junk. He starts off with 'what is Space Junk?', which tells you all about it and what it is. Then he tells you about what happens when they crash into things and how big of a deal it all really is.
25755	9	The author organizes this article in sections.  Each section has its own story and important information.  They are seperated into sections because not all of them flow together.  Each one emphasizes its own importance.
25756	9	He tells what is space junk, how it can get into space, and that no matter the size any thing that is floating around out there is harmful.
25757	9	An attention grabbing beginning, followed by explaining what space junk is, then saying that old satelites run the risk of crashing into each other and debris hitting the earth, followed by the dangers of micro debris.
25758	9	The author organizes the article by splitting it up into four sections that each have a different focus. The first section is the introduction, which states the topic and expresses the importance of the subject. This is proven when the article states that, 'This 'space junk'is currently of great concern to government space agencies around the globe.' The following section, 'What is Space Junk,' proceeds to explain exactly what space junk is and how it is created when it states that disabled objects, commonly from dead satellites, circle the globe in an uncontrolled orbit. The thrid section, 'Crash Course,' focuses on the dangers of dead satellites crashing into each other. The section states that after a satellite crash, instead of two dead satellites orbiting in space, there are hundreds of microsatellites, which can be much more dangerous. The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' restates the dangers of debris flying around in space and emphasises the situations they can cause. The sections states that, 'At extreme speeds, little bits can pack a punch powerful enough to create disastrous holes in an object moving through space.' The author separates the article into sections to help the reader understand certain aspects of space junk in a more organozed manner.
25759	9	space pollution can change and hurt the planets
25760	9	In this article the author uses a hook in the introduction to get the reader involved in the story and wanting to read more. The author then changes the tone, and expresses the seriousness of the topic. They begin to give background on what has happened in the past and how much damage it has done. The author is trying to give the reader information on how big of a deal they feel Space Junk is to our orbital pathways.
25761	9	The author organizes this article by starting with a introduction. Then the author goes on to explain the history of space junk and how it began. The author then goes on to explain the impact space debri does to other satellites, along with some statistical information about space junk. The author finishes the article with a conclusion
25762	9	he explains aboput the objects in space the junk that is found in there and then he goes on telling about how the objectsgot to space and in what way they have affected earth. he trie sto tell things that cause this nd then he tells of how they are going to affect us and how they have increased.
25763	9	The author starts with some staements to get the reader interested then goes into when the first satalite was shot into space. The author then talks about what happens to satalites that died and were free orbiting the dangers that could happen when satalites began to crash into each other. Then the author ends with explaining the after effects of a crash and the harm it does.
25764	9	First he comes off with humor to get you intrested. Then hits you with the serious stuff. He then he tells what space junk is. Then finally tells you about the crash problemand why it is so inportant to care.
25765	9	The author catches the attention of the reader by making a statement of something that is un realistic when saying there is a tool bag in the sky. Then it goes on to tell what space junk is or the stuff that floats around in our orbit that we can still see. After explaining that is tells of how the debris gets there and how it is harmful to further studies of outerspace or even the astronauts there to study it. The article is all put into place to tell the readers of how a small matter has turned into a very big problem for astrology.
25766	9	The author organizes the article by different paragraphs and titles. The introduction sets up the scene and presents the problem. The first section, 'What Is Space Junk', helps the reader understand all of the debris that pollutes our atmosphere. The second section, 'Crash Course', tells the reader about the crashes and collisions that happen in space. And finally, the 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section presents how we have tried to fix the microdebris problem in space.
25767	9	The author organizes the article by diving it into sections with headings. Each heading has information under it that corresponds to the heading.
25768	9	First, the author grabs the readers attention with the opening paragraph. Then, they go on to tell the readers about what space junk is. Next, they talk about how satellites and other things in space crash into eachother. Last, they explain how just the simple small things that float in space are harmful.
25769	9	The author organizes this article with different headings for different information. These headings preview the information to follow. These different headings explore many key items in explaining the 'space junk' problem.
25770	9	Has like exciting comments in the begining. Then through out the middle gets serious and tells the importance of what he is talking about. He also gives examples and many details. Then wraps it up by saying that something needs to happen for it will get worse.
25771	9	The author organizes the articles in specific sections. The sections are used to highlight very different, but very important topics. Rather than it being a long article, only seperated by paragraphs, the titled sections provide an easy way for readers to jump from topic to topic and to also refer back to certain sections.     The author titled each section specifically about what that section is about and provides information only about that given topic. By doing so the information comes in a comprendable order and doesn't feel generalized, but very specific.
25772	9	The author organizes this article by starting out extited to grad the readers attion then after the reader is in to the article he gets serous and starts on the real topic.

Like first he starts off with an introduction that is an attention getter, line 1 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' line 2 'It's a . . . tool bag?' Readers would be confused and shocked on why there is a  tool bag floating in space because its unusual.
25778	9	The author first introduces the topic by showing that space junk can sometimes be mistaken for comets or meteors.  Next, he or she explains what space junk is and how it got into space.  Following next is the explanation that if too much space junk is up in space, satellites will collide with each other, like two did in February of 2009.       He or she then makes a further explanation between the tiny space particles and speed, saying if the space junk was tiny particles of sand blowing in a gentle breeze, they would not be dangerous. However, when being blown from a sandblaster to take paint off of a concrete wall, the space junk particles become extremely dangerous.       The author then explains that space agencies are striving to make new developments in space travel safer, by building extra walls on space ships and making thicker space suits to try to reduce the impact of the particles.       The author then finishes it up, saying space agencies are working together to try to find a solution for space pollution.
25779	9	The author oraganized this article by breaking it up into its only little sections like, Orbiting Junk, What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal.

25781	9	The author satrts out by stating that you can observe space junk and it isn't as strange as it seems. The author goes on to explain what space junk is and how it got there. Then explains that when the technology goes dead, the risks of the satellite crashing into another and then the pieces crashing on Earth become higher. He goes on to explain that these little pieces of space junk, even if they down crashing into Earth, they are still a threat to astronauts who are on space missions.
25782	9	he does so by makeing titals of sections and then going in detail on such topics listed in the artical.
25783	9	The 'Space Junk' one is talking about the things that happen and or that can happen and stuff of spacecraft and about the earth and stuff. The 'Crash Course' is talking about the dangers and that sort of stuff.
25784	9	The author organizes the article by telling us the main ideas in order from least important to most.
25785	9	Talks about the Space Junk and the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite. Then the cras course and talks about the crash. The Little Bits But a Big Deal and talks aabout how space has trash floating around.
25786	9	The author opens with a interjections to help grab the reader's attention. He then shifts into historical facts and analysis to show the dangers of space junk. The author proceeds to tell about the effect that space junk can have on spaceships and satellites, and the risk that they can put on them. This helps show how space junk is a serious matter that can make or break a space exploration mission.

25788	9	First he uses some 'shocking statments' to draw the reader in.  Then elaborates on some termes given in the introduction and gives examples of them.  Explanes the danger of them, tells how the Space Junk can be formed, such as 'a tool box slipping out of a astronots hand' or 'two communication satillites traveling at 20,000 miles per hour coliding with each other.  He ends with explaning why all the little pieces are important and especially the larger pieces.
25789	9	He organizes it by writing the space events in order and telling about them in alphabetical order.

25792	9	The author starts off the passage getting your attention by relating it back to your life. Than the author talks about a time frame. Than the author talks about how space debri can be dangerous. Finally the passage says why we should be careful around these debri fragments because they can seriously harm the rockets we launch.
25793	9	The author uses the introduction to hook you in to reading the essay, than uses startling facts about space junk, and than talks about different items that are 'space junk'.
25794	9	In the article he shows how the stuff in space can be very harmful to spacecraft in the sky. It could hurt someone or even kill them from the fall of the spacecraft.
25795	9	The author tells about how bad things can happen up in space. He goes from the worst to not as bad. Just like the two satalites colliding.
25796	9	The author organized this very well. He used an introductory section, three main points, and a conclusion. I very much liked his introductory section; it really draws you in.
25797	9	At first, the author identifies the subject. Then, provides some history about the subject. Next, the author talks about how trash in space gets to small pieces and how it affects space exploration. Lastly, the author states problems that have been caused and problems that are still and will be caused if space explorations are continued, also maybe how to stop it and keep debris under control.
25798	9	the author organize the article by breaking each topic down in sections.
25799	9	I think the author is well organized is this article. The author starts talking about what space junk is and how important sattelites are. Then the author goes into greater detail and importance with the sattelite issue. The author then tells us how sattelites crash and how much damage it is to the Earth's atmosphere. Then the author finishes off with how the microdebris is harming our atmosphere greatly.
25800	9	The author starts the article with some interesting rhetorical questions to get the reader's attention. He then talks changes the mood of the article of a more serious sense so because the matter can cause damage. He talks about some different things in space and provides multiple facts. He ends with talking about how the space pollution can pose a serious problem.
25801	9	they start off with an attention grabbing beggining. 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?' Then they get all serious and go into 'What is space junk?' Then 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
25802	9	The author starts out with a good attention getter. Then gives a little information of the backround about the topic. From there the author states problems caused by all the space debris.
25803	9	First he explains what space junk is, then how it is harmful.
25804	9	The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention, explaining the topic, giving more specific details, and then stating the effects of space debris.  The author attracts the reader by stating that instead of finding a meteor or comet in the sky, one may see a too bag.  In the next paragraph, there are details listing what space junk is.  Next, the author tells of the history of space junk.  Lastly, the author emphasizes that space junk can be undetected, harmful to other space devices, and that space debris is pollution.
25805	9	Author organizes the article into subsections that cover an area of importance to the article. The first article, 'What Is Space Junk', talks about how 'object themselves, however, positioned hundred of miles above Earth.' The second article is named 'Crash Course,' and it talks how 'dead satelites run the risk of colliding with each other' and 'crashes that create debris.' The final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' talks about 'space debris present a very seriou problem.' What all this means is that its organized to deal with seperate things that go on in space and how things get there and how it has an effect of other space trips. That is how the article is organized.
25806	9	First off the autor makes it sound like it's really exciding so that it makes you want to read the story. Then talked about What is Space Junk, and went on from that. Told us a little bit about everything people call space junk. Like the space capsules, telescopes, and satellites.
25807	9	He organizes the article in by pollution and the history of the story of space the last frontier. He teaches about everything that you need to know for space.
25808	9	what is space junk? crash course? little bits, but a big deal.
25809	9	The author organizes this article by listing everything in oreder. They list the events in cronological order. They tell you what happened first, then tell you the dangers that effect it.
25810	9	The author organizes the article very well. It is four different sections about important things with space. the article has a lot of good information and facts.
25811	9	Many subsections break down the article to a smaller more manageable size, and give an easy way for the reader to find specific information
25812	9	He first starts off with a hook to catch the reader's attention, and then he starts stating facts and events of satellites that soon became 'space junk' over a period of time. He also gives a story of what happened when a toolbag was lost in space and how dangerous that could be. He finishes with stating that there should be a solution for space pollution.
25813	9	The author organizes the article by putting stuff into different catagories of stuff!! Everything the author talks about has a catagory that it fits best into and they talk about it! Like they talk about 'Crash Course' and all it talks about is satellites crashing into one another and debre!!
25814	9	Supports his or her intoduction with facts and statement. The author brings history into it and let's us know what has happened and how dangerous it is and how harmful it is.
25815	9	They start it off with something that will get your attention with a popular quote that we have al heard. Then they give you a basic deffinition and history about it and tell you how it started and which countries did. Then they explain how it is made or created by telling us that two 'dead' satellites collided and made many many pieces that are still there today.. Then in the final section they explain that this is a very serious matter and is not to be taken lightly.
25816	9	The author organizes the article by naming the different topics that he wants to talk about. He tells you about everything that is happening in space. How the trash in space is a bad thing and is not ok.
25817	9	He starts off the article by adding suspense. Then dropping to a more calm way. Eventually leading to the explanation of Space Junk.
25818	9	The author organized the artical by first making a very interesting introduction. Then by discribing what space junk actually is and how we have had a variety of space junk for over 52 years. In the third paragraph 'Crash Course' talks to use about how satellites in space and other objects can crash into eachother and completley distroy each other. Last but not least 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'  tells us about the danger of what can happen when two objects collide in space.
25819	9	The author organizes the article into multiple sections with their own headline, that tells what the writing is going to be about. For example, the section, 'Crash Course', explains how there have been many crashes due to the debris floating around in space. The way the author organized the article is helpful to the reader. For example, if the reader just wants to know what space junk actually is, they can skim the headlines and find something that deals with space junk, or if they just want to be informed about what dangers space junk causes, they can just read the section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
25820	9	The author starts with an introduction and then begins to provide the reader with background information. Then, the author provides an example of the problem and follows it up with a conclusion that sumarizes his point.
25821	9	The author put it in to part and talk about the important ideas of the seation in with the article is about. For an example if the title was satellites it would be talking about satellites.
25822	9	The author titles each section with a new name. Like 'What Is Space Junk?' This section gives a little history of space travel and the debri it is causing. Then 'Crash Course,' tells about different satellites crashing and creating more debri in space. Finally there is 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' which is used to make the reader realize even though the debri can be very small, it can cause a lot of damage.
25823	9	The author oraganize the article by putting intersting information in the introduction, then explaining everything about space junk like what is space junk.
25824	9	Author used an attention gather in introduction to start the article. It also shows what this article is about.     In the body paragraphs, he gave us enough informations to support the fact.
25825	9	The author organizes this article in different sections, they all have there own titles.
25826	9	The author organizes the article into three different topics. In one the author describes what 'Space Junk' is. In the second part, the author tells about how satellites crash into one another. Finally, in the last part, the author describes how dangerous all the tiny particles can truley be to our world. It also describes how harmful the debris can be to spacecraft.
25827	9	By letting the reader know what is going on and how we should understand what is going on and what could happen.
25828	9	The article is organized very proffesionaly and gives a great outline of information to the reader. R
25829	9	The author organized the article by time starting it with the great space invasion. He worked his way from the past to the present. Him starting with the great space invasion which started in 1957. Then he moved on to dead satellites that crashed into one another in Febuary 2009. Then he finished it up with the risk of tiny space debris.
25830	9	The author organizes the article by using startling statements in the begining to attract the reader's attention. It begins by saying 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then the article gets more serious and explains the harmful debris in space.
25831	9	he divides it by sections of different topics
25832	9	He organized it very well i think because he put facts about the articles in the right spots. and it all just makes since.
25833	9	He did put history first so you can lean  about what has happend and the improvements we have made. Such as we where the first on the moon.
25834	9	The author organize the article by talking about the Soviet Union frist and then by talking about the US and Russia. As Shown:'In 1957,the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.''With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other. That's exactly what happened in February 2009. Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth. The impact created hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path. Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.
25835	9	He first pulls you in with a good introduction. Then he explains what he is going to be talking about. After he gives you that background information he tells you the seriousness of the situation.
25836	9	They but everything in order in which they are going to talk about it. He/She put everything into grave detail which was more easy for me to understand as i was read the article.
25837	9	very well. i find it well organized with many good details.
25838	9	He organizes it very simpley and and easily.
25839	9	The author organizes this article by explaining what exactly space junk is then giving reasons why it can be very dangerous.
25840	9	Tho author organizes the article in different sections or points. The author starts with 'What Is Space Junk?' which describes space junk. Next comes 'Crash Course' followed by 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
25841	9	The author orginizes the article by giving the basic information needed to understand the subject first. Then by moving on to more serious matters and information. She also orginizes the article by topic and by giving each section of topic its own title.
25842	9	The author starts out the article with an introduction to catch your attention. He then tells you about space junk and tells when it began, what it is and how it happens. He then goes on to say what happens when they do crash and the after effects. He tells an event that happened like the tool bag that came out of an astronaut's hand and is now traveling through space. He goes on to tell the damage the space junk can do. The author wraps up the article by stating that space junk is a problem.
25843	9	The author starts out playi
25844	9	He first tells us that space junk is a problem in our workd to this current day and year. Then he strts to tel us when it first started that was in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched there first satellite. The United states fallowed right behind them. There they went into space close to eachother every day.      In the next 52 years there has been more space junk. They have launched tones of diffrent space crafts and some of them ahve lostsome parts to the ship that htey where on.      Now its at the part were it tells where if the statlites arent working that itcauses a major threat to the world. Beacuse a dead aircraft or space ship if it hits something that is working there is a posiablity that when they hit eachother that the working one will shut down beacuse of it being hit and breaking. Thus causeing them both to hit Earth and destroying land or killing some people in the prosses.       Finaley it tells us how to compair how it woud effect us on Earth. If an aircraft or spaceship would hit something in space it would damange the spacecraft and make more space junk.
25845	9	in a good, understandable way.
25846	9	The author organizes the article in a logical way.  He begins by making a broad reference to what he is about to discuss.  He does this while grabbing the reader's attention with shocking statments and presenting a scenario that the reader can relate to.  Then, he better describes the subject of the criticism and how it came to be.  In this section, he incorporates background knowledge and historical events that impacted the problem.  Afterwards, he describes the actual problem.  Then, he proceeds to explain why the problem is such a big deal and what is being done to prevent or protect against the problem.
25847	9	The author organizes the article by categorizing more threatening causes of space junk, all leading up to the surprisingly big problem. He explains how space junk is caused, and how simple, yet dangerous it can be.
25848	9	The author organizes the article in a very clear, orderly fashion. The article starts off with a catchy introduction. It says, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a ...tool bag?' After this, the author switches from fun to a more serious tone. He states, 'This 'space junk' is currently of great concern to government space agencies around the globe.' After the introduction, the author explains what space junk really is. He writes, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.' After he explains what it is, he goes onto tell what might happen when two satelites collide. He says, 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.' After this paragraph, he goes one to tell us how this debris can affect us. The author states, 'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' The author then wraps it all up with his conclusion.
25849	9	Mirico means small so mirico dibres means small dibres.
25850	9	He talks about space and the astronauts and the space junk how it can fall from space.
25851	9	The author describes what exactly the space junk actually is in thise case its satellites and other things including small peices of the satellites. Then follows with the Crash Course part of the writing that tells how the junk got there, uncluding satellite crashes. Also the little bits of junk may not seem that there a problem but the Little Bits, But Big Deal section tells that there is a problem with the little peices of junk to.
25852	9	He organized the article into diffrent sections which he then titled like 'Little Bits, But a Big Problem' in each of these parts he talked about a diffrent subject that still pertained to the thesis.
25853	9	First the author makes a statement that how once orbital pathways were clear in space but are now filled with space debry. Then the author explains to us the history of space and how vairous amounts of objects have been sent in space, or lost in space. Nex the author states how there is nobody controlling these object that when they are dead or fully used, they just roam around in space at highly dangerous speeds, and even the littlest of part could cause great damage to objects. Now scientists are tryign to corporate nations so they can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.
25854	9	He starts out with when the first artifical satellite was launched, and then about some of the crashes that have happened, and finally he talks about random space junk.
25855	9	The author first gains audience attention with a brief summary of the problem of space junk, and then in successive groups of paragraphs fleshes out the problem. His first group introduces thesubject's history, starting with the space race and the first accident. The second group specifically describes the results and likelihood of collisions.The third group describes the impact of microdebris slamming into larger satellites.
25856	9	With one section talking about space junk ,another defining space junk, one talking about satellites, one about satellite collisions,one about debri, another about NASA.
25857	9	They go from some smal things to larger trash like satellites. they all talk about how harmful the things are though. They also start with the history of the space races which i think is good right aafter the intro.
25858	9	This author organizes the article simply:  introduction to the concept of space junk, the great space invasion which ultimately leads to a crash course in space junk, and conclusion of the damage that these 'micodebris' can do to the Earth or even aircraft that are on their way to explore outerspace.  The author entices the reader with their opening three exclamations and hooks them on the idea of a tool bag in outerspace.  Then, the author adds information about about what space junk actually is before telling the readers of the crash that results in space junk.  Finally, the author writes:  'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.  If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  This statement is used to shock the reader into realizing just how dangerous this space junk really is.
25859	9	First, he hints that space exploration is a dangerous mater. Then, he explains why artificial satellites are in space. Then lastly he explains in depth to danger of microdebris.
25860	9	he organize it by giving detels first
25861	9	The author organizes the article by first introducing the topic of discussion, then giving a history of how the space debris got there, then explaining how some satellites become smaller and deadlier, and lastly by explaining that it is a major problem.
25862	9	The author organizes the article in a topic by topic way. The article is seperated into four mini sections. Each section has a few paragraphs on a certain topic. For example, the section titled 'What is Space Junk?' is all about space junk and what is it. Another example is the section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', it talks about how even though the materials in space are small they still make a big impact and people care.
25863	9	The author organizes the article by telling us what Space junk is, then telling us how much of a big deal it is to us, and how we can get rid of it.
25864	9	The author organizes the article in a way that emphasizes how space junk can be harmful.
25865	9	The author organizes the artical with an attention getting statement first, and second he goes into detail about how 'space junk' gets into the Earth's atmosphere. Third he or she explains how the satellites have risks of colliding with each other, and what happens to the debris, and fourth the author talks about the rates of the tiny debris fragments and about how the scientists are looking for an easy solution to get rid of 'space junk'
25866	9	he talks about the reasons why space junk is dangerous to the atmosphere and the satellites in space causing them to crash eventually due to the difficulty it is to steer clear of the debris.
25867	9	The author organizes the article by using the last sentence of a section to lead into the next section. For example, the last sentence of the introduction mentions that the 'space junk' is a great concern around the world; then the author continues the next section, 'What Is Space Junk?', explaining the reason why space junks were created. This section concludes with a sentence saying the disabled satallite objcts circled the orbit uncontrolled, which leads into the next section where it explains the danger of the dead satellites colliding with each other. This method creates the effect of questioning and answering, which allows the reader to absorb the complex information slowly and thoroughly.
25868	9	The author organizes the article into subsections that operate both in the general context of the article and under their own headings. These sections are organized so that the reader learns more about space junk, its history, and the dangers it presents in a logical order. The author starts with defining space junk, and progresses to the final heading 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' which ultimately states that the author's true purpose in writing this article is to illustrate to the reader how big a problem space junk is for the world.
25869	9	How the Orbiting Junk get into spave. He first started off the article with something that will grab reads thought's. Second he talks about the Crash Course on what the harmful things out are space are. Thered thing the author talk's about is Little Bits, But a Big Deal, it talks about how the it increased more about what we know about space. In conclsion, he is doing the right thing about space and how fun it is to float around in the space shudile.
25870	9	the author organize the space junk of the concern to the government space agencies around the glode.
25871	9	The author organizes the article by putting each thing in its own catagory. For example 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is about sattliets crasshing.
25872	9	He gets your attention, than expresses the importance of space junk, than he tells you what space junk is, He tells you about what space junk has done in the past, and lastly he stresses again that space junk is a big deal.
25873	9	He mainly just puts it together very nice and is comfortable with writing what he 's got or what he has.
25874	9	The author organizes the article by first starting off with little questions, or sayings. Then moving onto important facts about spacelife and when things have happend. The author gives dates of different things and also gives reasons behind why he is talking abou that ceratin topic at that given momnet. The author also organized the article by 'Crash Courses'. Next with 'Little Bits, But a big deal'. He Talks about a lot but seperated each topic.
25875	9	he arranges it in an order that makes more sense as you read further. he starts off with the history of space exploration. then it goes into problems that can occur.
25876	9	The author organizes this story with the problem, more stuff wrong with space travel, then a solution to the problem, then goes back to some more problems, then sums it up with what we could do to help.
25877	9	The author organizes his article very well. He first grabs your attention with exciting exclamations, and tells what his article will mostly talk about. He then explains in depth the subject of his article, space junk. After he explains this, he talks about how the space junk ended up where it is. Finally he talks about how big of an impact this space junk creates, and who is responsible for this.
25878	9	The author organized the work into subcatagories with their own titles. For example 'What Is Space Junk' and 'Crash Course'. These headings where very helpful the the organization of the long article.
25879	9	the author organizes his article by putting it in paragraph structrue
25880	9	The author organizes the article with headings within the atricle and in the sections of the headings explains what the heading is talking about.
25881	9	In the introduction the author talks about looking into the a night sky to see things in space, while doing so, they see a tool bag. The tool bag is used to talk about, what the author calls, space junk. As the story goes on, the author talks about what space junk really is, then goes on to talk about that it can cause crashes, and then on to the sizes of debris.
25882	9	The aurthor uses a title for each segment. Alowing the reader stay on track.
25883	9	The author organizes the article by introducing us to the topic, and then using three different sections to give us information about space junk. The introduction includes the author's thesis, and then he expands on it in the next three sections. The 'What Is Space Junk?' section gives us details on what space junk really is, and how it comes about. The 'Crash Course' section talks about the dangers of dead satellites colliding in orbit by providing us with an example of a Russian and American satellite colliding in 2009. The 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section is providing us information on why space junk is actually a serious problem because of the damage it can inflict. The author organizes the information in a way that readers can understand and really learn about the impact space junk has.
25884	9	The author organizes in the article by giving headings for each sections. For example 'What Is Space Junk?' provides us clues that that section is going to explain to the reader what space junk is. 'Crash Course' is going to tell us how satellites sometimes collide with other satellites in space, and so on.
25885	9	the author tells of the dangers and of the power of the small space junk has like the tool bag it can be very dangerous do to the power and force that its orbiting with
25886	9	The author first tries to get your attention by using exclamination. Then, the author tells about facts about dangers in space.
25887	9	He organize the article to show us how everything works how he starts out by using orbiting junk to get us to see what its mainly bout, then he takes us on dealit to let us know why hes telling us then. Then he goes onto explaining why this stuff happens, what it does to the space ships, and letting us know why we should care.
25888	9	The author started the article off with what the 'space junk' is before telling people how it is a problem. He wanted people to know what it was so that they knew what he was talking about.      If the readers knew what he was talking about then they would see how its a problem in space and how it is not good for space.
25889	9	By introducing a problem and then giving evidence on it and true statements.
25890	9	the author grabs the readers attention at first. then they go into conclusion about what space junk is and describing it. After that the author talks about a crash course thats happened in the past. the author then talks about how a little bit of space junk is a big deal. since you already know about space junk you know it can be a big deal. he then finishes it off by stating that hpefully america and other countries can get together and help solve the problem of so much space junk in the air.
25891	9	the author organize the article by putting everything in the order . Talk about what is space junk.
25892	9	The author organizes it by saying what normal people would say. Because a lot of people don't know anything about space. He tells us what it really is. He goes into telling what space junk is. And how it effects the satellites, the risk of colliding into each other. He changes the tone after the introduction to really tell us that it's a big deal.
25893	9	The author orgainzed the article in a way that would catch the reads attention the slowly work its way into the more serious matter, for example the dangerous of 'Space Junk' and the damage that it can cause to our space shuttles and our planet. It was planned out well, most people don't want to read about space, nor do they care, but the author wrote this in a manner that was respectable and perculiar.     They did not blame anyone, the mearly just believe that this is a serious manner that needs to be resolved somehow, before it becomes a deadly problem to astronauts. 'In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing becasue commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration' the author at this point has a forewaring tone, she isn't condoning this, but they would much enjoy if everyone found a way to find a soultion to the problem.
25894	9	The author starts off with a introduction then moves on and talks about space junk. After that he goes from topic to topic.
25895	9	The author organizes the article in sections, like chapters to get the full details of the story.  The sections are headed with a main detail to inform you whats coming up in the section.
25896	9	The author organizes this article with an introduction, his main body paragraphs with his main topics, and finally a conclusion. Just like a five paragraph essay.
25897	9	The author orginizes the article using sub headings.'What Is Space Junk''Crash Course''Little Bits, But a Big Deal'
25898	9	The author organizes it in sections to make it easier to follow and understand the importance of space junk. You learn in the first section that satellites can be shut down. You also learn that accidents happen in space.
25899	9	The author orginizes the article by sections that lead into each other.
25900	9	The author organizes the article by strategically ordering the topics he talks about in order of importance.
25901	9	The author gets your attention first then gets to the facts then the importance of the space junk. He wants to get you pulled in so that you can get excited and want to know more about it. The author brings up the history of the things that happened to let you know that this could happen again easily.
25902	9	The author first explains what space junk is, and then goes on to write about some of the space junk that has existed. He tells about how dangerous and can be and are making people aware of it. 'Thos bits of space debris present a very serious problem' says the writer, trying to emphasize how it can be dangerous.
25903	9	The author organizes the article by describing every detail of space junk possible.  He/she begins by explaining what space junk is.  Then the author gives possible problems and outcomes.  Lastly, the author describes why space junk is a big deal, and very dangerous.
25904	9	The author organizes his article very well, I think. I think that the author has every bit of information in perfect order. He has very many facts to back up his information, he explains how loose tools in space would effect space crafts and people on earth. I think that the author supports his article greatly.
25905	9	The author organizez his information by how much certain pieces of it relate with other pieces of information. Such as you wouldn't find any information that defines space junk in the paragraph entitled 'Crash Course'.
25906	9	The aunthor talks about what it is. then he gives a disctription of space junk. Then tha author talks about the crash course and how you cant control a sattalite or anything like that from running into space debre. Then the author talks about how the littliest partricle of space debre can be very dangerous if it gets up to speed and hits another oject at a fast speed.
25907	9	The author organizes the article into sections about different details about space junk. Each section contains different details and information about the space junk.     First, in What is Space Junk, the author explains what Space Junk really is. They give information about how some of the junk can circle the world for indefinitely, how some of it will never ever go away, and can cause harm and problems.     Second, in the section Crash Course the author explains how objects up in space can crash into one another and can cause many problems. Even a simple tool bag lost in space could have a harmful effect.     Lastly, In Little Bits, But a Big Deal they tell how many people actual care how much space trash there is. Some of the effects of the space junk can cause just as much damage as a sand blaster to a painted concrete wall.
25908	9	The author organized the article very well , The entire article was very organized.
25909	9	The author organizes the article by first telling us about space junk and what it is. Then goes into crash course telling us about what happen with a crash course. Finally the author talks little bits, but a big deal. Little bits, but big deal cause a disatrous hole in an object moving in space.
25910	9	The author organizes this article by putting the historical information first. He/she lets us know when space satellites were first put into space, and what has happened since then with the explorations. Then the author goes on to explain what happens to all the clutter left behind in the explorations themselves; like the two communication satellites crashing, and the tool bag that was lost by an astronauts doing repairs. Finally the author lets us know that many people do care about the debris, and that NASA and teh European Space Agency has found a way to tell just how big some of the debris is. Although they can't see things smaller than a baseball, they can tell that the space trash amount is increasing.
25911	9	The author organizes the article by first using a hook-a well known phrase to catch the readers' attention. After that they use explanations, interesting facts, and a summary of the problem and a possible solutions.
25912	9	by
25913	9	The author begins the article with a simple tone which leads into a more serious yet informational tone.
25914	9	The order of the article is arranged in a very organized way; first, the author grabs the reader's attention by making the subject interesting with reader interaction. Then the problem is brought up and explained; first by defining what the problem is and why it is a problem. Finally, the article is concluded with a statment of an idea on how to illiminate the problem.
25915	9	The author starts the article out by saying, It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a... tool bag? Which then leads into talking about 'space junk.' Then the author talks about some history of spacecrafts and other objects. The author then talks about different crashes having to do with satellites. Finally the author goes on to talk about tiny fragments can be dangerous.
25916	9	The author of the article 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article in a specific way.  The author first starts out by gaining the reader's attention by using shocking statements.  The first sentence, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! Its a meteor!' is used to make the reader think something bad is about to happen.  The reader might think that a meteor is crashing down to Earth or that something else dangerous might happen.  After gaining the reader's attention the author then goes on to say that it is nothing more that a tool bag.  The reader most likely now thinks that the beginning narrator is not actually looking up into space, when they actually are.  The reader is probably now curious as to what the beginning narrator is looking at.  The author now explains that what the narrator is seeing is 'space junk.'  This paragraph explaining that the beginning narrator is seeing 'space junk' is enticing the reader into wanting to read more.  In the next section labeled 'What Is Space Junk?' is used to explain exactly what space junk is.  The author uses these paragraphs to explain that space junk can be just about anything.  In the section 'Crash Course' the author uses actual events that have occured to explain to the reader that even malfunctioning satellites can become space junk if they completly quit working, or if they are unable to be controlled by people on Earth anymore.  In the final section of the article, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author summarizes that all the different pieces of space junk can be as large as a satellite to smaller than a baseball.  The author explains that objects smaller than a baseball are unable to be detected and because of this, the space ships that orbit into space have to have more layers of walls and protection to protect them from the microdebris.  This article is organized in a way to help the reader understand all that they can about what space junk is and what problems it may cause.  The author has a very efficient way of organizing the article and the article is easy to understand.
25917	9	The author organizes his article into sections starting with an introduction. Then the author moves into the main points of what he is trying to get across to the reader. First he talks about the history of satellites in 'What is Space Junk.' In 'Crash Course', he talks about how satellites collide. Then in the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' he talks about what to do as a solution to this harmful problem.
25918	9	With facts first.
25919	9	The author organized the article to catch the readers eye at the start and then to inform them of the pollution of the space today. He organized it that each paragraph had its on kind of infromation, also titled them so that the information that the reader was looking for could be found easily.
25920	9	The author organized the article into main sections. Each section discusses a particular part of space junk. These sections include what it is, how it got there, and why is it important. He supported these with facts and examples.
25921	9	he puts it in to catagories and explains them
25922	9	This article is organized differently then most. It starts with somewhat of a dialouge then turns into facts. It asks questions then defines the answers well.
25923	9	He organizies it in paragraph form which is put into parts to give you reasons to belive that space junk is dangerous to the space shuttles.
25924	9	The author made it so that the more important details where at the beggining the the end of the article. By doing so he was able to keep the readers attention for the entire time they were reading it. Making it so that the reader wants to read it is most likely to be one of the hardest thing that the author had to do. In the beigging he tells about what happened to the satelites and at the end he tells about how the debree is a major factor in space.
25925	9	The author gives a problem, then explains it. They then explain what causes the problem, and what effects it has. Then they give solutions to the problem along with other details.
25926	9	badly cause they just kinda jump around and dont get right to the point
25927	9	The author orgnizes the article in a flowing order to make the reader better able to understand what he/she is reading. The author starts by explaing what started creating 'space junk' to appear outside earth's atmosphere, then went on to how things can go into their own orbit, and that incresing space research is only making the matter of 'space junk' worse.
25928	9	The author organizes the article by importance. They had the attention getter first. After the attention getter they explained what space junk is. Then they stated more startling statistics about space crashes. Lastly, they explained how space junk compares to other things and emphasizes how dangerous it is.
25929	9	The author organizes the article by getting the reader interested in the article and then by showing the reader that space junk is bad and that it can damage the earth everytime the space junk crashes into the earth. According to paragraph ten it states, ' Scientist are hard-pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk' (paragraph 10). This states that it is a hard time to keep it safe.
25930	9	The author explains that and how space junk is a serious matter, nomatter what size it is.
25931	9	The author organized this artice into questions the reader may have about space exploration. The author then gives a short incident that relates to that question and explains.
25932	9	The author start by grabbing the readers attention. They then go on to explain what space junk actually is, and after this they explain some situations in which the debris is created with the section entitled 'Crash Course.'  The last, but certainly not least, movement that the author makes toward organization, is to explain what the importance and seriousness of space junk.     The author certainly emphasizes the danger that astronauts face when they are sent on missions in the last section.
25933	9	The author starts you calm and fun but then he goes in to basicly a list of what he/she is talking about. He/she goes into asking what is space junk. Tells you facts and keeps in interesting then moves on to more topic that has the same feel to it.
25934	9	The author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is.  When the author gave the reader information about space junk, he explained the many ways that the junk may get into space.  Last the author informs the reader that the little bits of space junk floating around can actually cause major damage.
25935	9	They begin by telling about how space junk has cluttered up orbital pathways and how they are dangerous, and then they  provided examples of things that has happened to show that space junk is dangerous, and finally talks about how the issue is becoming a bigger concern every day with more space junk piling up into the orbital pathway.
25936	9	They organize it in a very clean cut way. They have everything in order so it is easy to read, and flows very good.
25937	9	He tells the story in order
25938	9	The author goes from the first satelite. Then begins to tell us that it is dangerous if satelites crash into eachother. Finally the author begins to say how bad it is if the satilites crash into eachother.
25939	9	The author organizes the article into four organized sections. The first section is titled 'Orbiting Junk' and this is the introductary paragraph that overviews the entire writing piece. The next section introduces the history of space and how the 'Space Junk' appeared there. The third section is titled 'Crash Course' and this tells actual facts about a time when two satellites acutally crashed while in orbit. This helps give more statistics about the writing. The last section called, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' explains how this problem affects us, and how we can help.
25940	9	the article states that the soviet union was the first to send a satellite in to space. and then it talks about other satellites going in to space.
25941	9	The author organized the article in order of the old things first then going into the furture. Under 'What is Space Junk' is 1957 and goes over the next 52 years.  'Crash Course' is the now and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the furture.  That is how the author organized the article.
25942	9	The author sections his article from his main idea of 'Space Junk', and then condenses it down to the composing elements such as 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', and explains all of the smaller contributions to the bigger problem. Also, he sections off the effects of 'Space Junk' in the section titled 'Crash Course'.
25943	9	The author organizes the article in an efficient, orderly, and easy-to-read manner. The author created different sections with different titles such as 'What Is Space Junk?' and 'Crash Course.' Each different section discusses a certain topic. For example, 'What Is Space Junk?' discusses how research satellites can become debri in space. These multiple sections help the reader to focus on a certain topic at a time. In addition, because all of the sections are in a logical order, they give the reader an easier transition into the next topic. For example, a reader who is reading this article would first be wondering about space junk and then how it is made. In the article, the author first discusses what space junk is and then discusses, in the section 'Crash Course,' how it is made.
25944	9	The author organizes the article in a way to inform people. He/she describes 'Space Junk' in order for people reading this to understand what is being talked about. The author then uses specific dates to show the severity of the problem.
25945	9	It tells you about how the space junk got there and how it gets out of space and it talks about how crash course and it talks about Little Bits, But a Big Deal hwo they all get in to space.
25946	9	He orginizes it by talking about space and the satellites. then he talks about how stellites have crashed into eachother creating space junk. And it talks about how these small pieces of junk are a huge deal because some satellites can pick them up on the radar and how the pieces of junk travel very fast through space and can doa lot of damage.
25947	9	He organizes this story but catching your eye at first. Then he tells you about the history of that. Then finding out facts of them.
25948	9	The author organizes the artical by using supporting deatils events that have occured thing that might happen and history on space.
28135	10	light gray ::  that color will keep the doghouse cool when i ts hot, but not too cold that it would be uncomfortable for the dog. I believe this because the light gray has an average temperature of 45(DEG) c. the white is three degrees lower than that, the dark gray was three degrees above light gray and black was another five degrees above that.
28136	10	black :: black is more atractive to the sun and it mak e more things warmer or hotter
28137	10	light gray :: I picked light gray because its not to hot of a color and not to cold of a color
28138	10	white ::  it will keep it cooler inside, because white reflects heat, which means it wouldn't be entering the house.
28139	10	light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray will affect th temp. by making it warm. Not too cool and not too hot. For example, in the results light gray was 45(DEG)C while black was 53(DEG)C and white was 42(DEG)C.
28140	10	white ::  it should reflect more thermal energy becuase the higher flouresent look while black is dark and absorbs more t hermal energy
28141	10	white ::  that color would keep the dog house colder th an the other ones. white reflects light and darker colors absorb the heat .
28142	10	black :: The black will create more energy in the doghouse for more air temperature.
28143	10	light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keeping it warm because light gray is does not absorb a lot of energy but it absorves enough energy to keep the doghouse warm.
28144	10	dark gray :: I chose dark gray for the color the doghouse should be painted because, doghouses are used to keep the dog warm at nig ht or for shade on a hot day and the color is even on both. For example, it cold outside(24(DEG)C) and the dog goes inside the dog house which is (about 48(DEG)) the dog is better of in the dog house.
28145	10	black ::  if you painted a doghouse black, then if the sun was out the doghouse will be warmer than it would be if it was any ot her color. during the glass jar experiment, black had a average tempature of 53(DEG) which was 5(DEG) higher than the second hottest color.
28146	10	white :: The white color absorbs less heat from the su n than black color. This will help the dog keep cool and fresh. The dog w ill not be hot if the color is white. The average of the white color is 4 2(DEG)c. The average of black is 53(DEG)c. So what color is the coolest ? The answer is white.
28147	10	black :: if they use black paint for their doghouse, t hen heat with stay in because black obsorbs heat.
28148	10	"white :: The color white would make the dog house very cool because, it said ""in the passage that the darker the color the hotter it gets because it absorbs the energy"". So, by chooseing whi te i think the dog and the dogs house will be alto cooler"
28149	10	white ::  this color would keep the doghouse cooler bec ause in the experiment the white lid's heat had an average of 42(DEG)C a nd the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C. the white lid was 11(DEG) cooler than the black lid.
28150	10	black :: You should use black because that attracts th e most heat, and can be the warmest temperature for the dog.
28151	10	black ::  The color black might affect the doghouse by the temperature staying at a comfortable level so its not too hot and not too cold just like in the expirement how the dark black lid stayed on average a comfortable 53(DEG).
28152	10	white :: White is the best choice because according to the table it attracts the least amount of heat, therefore it is the best opption.
28153	10	dark gray :: In the winter it well ceep the dog house warm , but not so much that the dog geats heat stroke in the summer.
28154	10	white :: if you paint the doghouse white, then your do g will stay much cooler on hot days because white reflects heat away.
28155	10	light gray ::  This way, the dog house doesn't get too hot from the sun, because you can see from Brandi and Jerry's experiment that having a dark colored doghouse could make it too hot for the dog, but having it completely white might make it too cold. This is because dark colors absorb more light.
28156	10	white :: I would choose white because it reflects the sun and back makes it hotter.
28157	10	black :: The black would make the dog house warmer ins ide for the doggy.
28158	10	"white ::  White will make the doghouse cooler. Li ke in the ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar"" expe riment. The white lid had a cooler temperature compared to black, d ark gray, and light gray."
28159	10	white :: the white color will reflect most of the radi ation waves so that it will be cooler in the dog house.
28160	10	black ::  black paint coler is 53 degrees and white pa int coler is 42 degrees thats 11 degreese warmer than white
28161	10	dark gray :: it will make the dog house warm
28162	10	white :: The color white might effect the dog house by scince color white is not a dark color it doesn't obsorb as much heat as dark colors do, so the dog house could be cooler by adding a lighter color to the dog house.
28163	10	light gray ::
28164	10	light gray :: Because if colour is dark it is gonna have mo re temperature but if colour is light it is gonna have less temperature.
28165	10	black :: there will be more light inside of the dog ho use and more heat.
28166	10	white ::  You wouldnt wanna use a dark color for the do g house because the darker the color the more the color absorbes energy f rom the sun, causing the inside of the dog house to get hotter thus in ca using the dog to over heat. Not a good thing for a dog. After the 10mins of testing each color of lid white had an average tempeture of 42(DEG)c and black had an averge temp eture of 53(DEG)c. White had 11(DEG)c less then black did
28167	10	white :: I chose white because the color reflects the most amount of heat, data from the table shows that the darker the color the hotter the temperture the color collects. Yherfore the dog house should be a light color.
28168	10	dark gray :: I think that dark gray would be the best choi ce I think this because dark gray will alow for some warm air to enter on a cold day. Also on a hot day it will not absorb to much heat for the ho use to over heat. Dats that supports this is in the experiment black's te mputure increased the most starting at 24(DEG)C and rising to 53(DEG)C. When the wite only rose to 42(DEG)C starting also at 24(DEG)C. W hen dark gray was some what in the middle with 48(DEG)C(starting at 24(DEG) C).
28169	10	light gray :: it well afect a lil bit. because it light gra y .
28170	10	white ::  It will make the inside of the doghouse coole r because the average temperature was 42(DEG)C and Black, which is the d arkest color, was on average 53(DEG)C.
28171	10	white ::  When summer comes the dog will be nice and cool inside the dog house with the sun hitting the doghouse because the w hite paint won't attract the heat as much as black paint would. So the do g will be nice and cool, instead of hot and sad.
28172	10	white ::  This color (white) may affect the dog house with heat . The white keeps the room cool, because its not a dark color like black so it doesnt attract the sun and heat so much. If you were to use the table in the experiment as a reference you would see that white k eeps the jar the coolest out of all the colors.
28173	10	white :: If you choosed the color white for a doghouse , then according to the glass jar data, the doghouse would be cooler then if it was a black doghouse.
28174	10	white :: white might affect the doghouse because it wo nt attract as much heat, the average is 42(DEG)c
28175	10	light gray ::  The color of the dog house is dependant on th e climate in which the dog is living. For instance, a black dog hou se is best suited to a cold climate like Alaska, where it would help to k eep the dog house warm during the cold winter. But if you live in a warm climate like San Diego, the best color for the dog house would be w hite. The white would help to reflect the heat, keeping the dog coo l during the hot summer. If the dog lived in Northwestern Washingto n, I would say the best color for the dog house is light gray. The light gray would keep the dog warmer in the the winter than the white. The data provided shows that the light gray is on average 3(DEG) warmer than t he white. But would allow the dog to be cool enough in the summer, as the light gray is on average 3(DEG) cooler than the dark gray and 7(DEG) c ooler than the black. If I had to choose a color for the dog house I woul d choose light gray as it would work best for the area in which I live. This question was written poorly because there isn't a definite answer and ther efore is a matter of opinion. More information should be given in t he question to help the student make the correct choice.
28176	10	light gray :: Light grey is about good temperature for a do g in a dog house. Warm. The table says that light grey and dark grey are between white and black so i chose something in the middle.
28177	10	white ::  The color white would affect the inside of the doghouse by keeping it cool. In the experiment, the white lid color had an average of 42(DEG)C while black had an average of 53(DEG)C. That's a difference of 11(DEG)!. A doghouse that's white should keep the dog nice and cool in the summer.
28178	10	light gray ::  Light gray will atract a little light, but not to much. Black would atract alot of heat and that wouldn't be good so would dark gray but light gray wouldn't atract as much and white would n't really atract any heat.
28179	10	white ::  White is the best color to paint the dog hous e because white absorbed the least amout of heat.
28180	10	white ::  I would use white for the doghouse roof, because it would keep the doghouse cooler inside for the dog. In the experiment, when a white lid was used, it's average change in temperature was 11(DEG) C less than the average temperature change using the black lid, concluding that a lighter colored roof will keep the doghouse cooler.
28181	10	white ::  White would be the best paint color because on a sunny hot day it would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than a darker colored doghouse. This can be proven because in the experement the black lid had an average inside temperature of 53(DEG)C and the white lid had an average inside temperature of 42(DEG)C. Therefore a white dog house would be 11(DEG)C cooler than the black dog house.
28182	10	white :: If we paint the dogs house white then it woul d get more cooler because white mostly atracts about 42c.
28183	10	white ::  this color will affect the doghouse by decreasing the temperature heat and it will actually cause the doghouse to be more cooler.
28184	10	dark gray ::  suck it
28185	10	white :: This will efect the doghouse because, the lig hter the color the lesss attracted to by the sun or heat source. Results from the text say the average temperature inside the glass jar, with the white lid was 42(DEG) C, and the starting temperature was 24(DEG) C.
28186	10	black :: it is the darkest
28187	10	white :: The color I chose may effect the doghouse bec ause different colors react differently in certain temperatures for examp le white absorbs it.
28188	10	white :: The color will affect the doghouse temperatur e becuase if you paint a dog house black it would make it all hot inside. But if you paint it white, it will stay cool and moist.
28189	10	black :: this color would affect theheat in the dog ho use becuase black atracts heat. this you should use if the dog needs to w arm because the average temp was 53c 5c more than the last one
28190	10	white :: white would reflect the heat and the dog hous e would be cooler
28191	10	black :: This color of the dog house might make it to hot for the dog. The average of the black is 53 degrees and the average f or the white is 42 degrees.
28192	10	black :: the color is really dark and can get it to be really hot inside and the dog might die if there is no fresh cold air.
28193	10	light gray :: i chose light gray and it might effect the do g house by keeping the dog house not to hot and not to cold because it is the color with the mediem amount of heat
28194	10	dark gray :: it won't make it too hot or too cold it will be just right
28195	10	white :: The color affects the doughouse in that the l ighter the color, the cooler it stays.(which is good because dogs can't o verheat) and the darker it is, the hotter it gets inside.
28196	10	white :: the paint color white will make the inside of the doghouse the least hot because based on the results, white had the l owest air temperature, if they use white, the inside wont get too hot
28197	10	white :: Painting a dog house white would keep the ins ides of the dog house cooler than other colours would.
28198	10	white ::  I would choose white so the dog house does not get to hot inside.Black would heat the dog house to much.
28199	10	dark gray ::  it will keep the same temp because in the dat a table it says 48 for trial 1, 48 for trial 2, 48 for trial 3,and as one can see 48 will obviously be the averge
28200	10	black ::  the black paint will keep ot warm inside the dog house, to keep the dog warm.
28201	10	white ::  Brandi and Jerry might want to color the doghouse white because the data shows that the average temperature (42(DEG)C after 10 minutes) will keep the dog the coolest inside a white colored doghouse.
28202	10	white :: The house will be at the coldest temperature that it can be out of all the other colors.
28203	10	white :: that color will make the dog house cooler because they was studing to find out if dark colors change the temp and the white is the cooler on with all the trials they did.
28204	10	white :: the color will either make it hoter or colder inside the doghouse, this is why i would choose white to paint the dogho use because in the experiment it created the lowest temperatures in the j ar.
28205	10	white :: If the color was darker the air inside would get hotter than if the color was lighter. According to the data from the expiriment the darker colors heated up more than the lighter colors
28206	10	black :: I choose the color black for it will make the dog house warmer to live in. For the Hot Lamp experiment showed that the darker the lid color the warmer the air is inside. For when the lid was black it had an average of 53(DEG)C and when the lid was white it had an average temperature of 42(DEG). With a difference of 11(DEG).
28207	10	white ::  White would be the best color because on a ho t summers day the inside of a white doghouse would not be nearly as hot a s the inside of a black or dark gray or even a light gray doghouse. And t he color white absorbs the least heat than all of the other colors do, so white would be your best bet for a nice cool doghouse.
28208	10	black :: black would be the best color because the dar ker the color the more energy it obsorbes so the dog house will be warmer and heated.
28209	10	white ::  White doesn't attract as much light energy as darker colors would.
28210	10	light gray :: how this color might affect the doghouse is b ecause it isn't too hot or cold, it is the coolest one, the average is 45 (DEG)C.and the black one is 53(DEG)C and white is 42(DEG)C.
28211	10	white :: in the experament white was the least hot so i would use whit to keep te dog nice and cool and by using white u will b e able to see the dog house in the nite witch ive ran into mine at nite i t sucks
28212	10	black :: painting the doghouse black would make it war mer for the dog.
28213	10	black :: If Brandi and Jerry live in a colder climate, I would recomend them painting the house black because as you can tell b y the experiment results, the darker the color, the warmer it will be ins ide.
28214	10	white :: that is going to make it hot in ther for the dog.
28215	10	dark gray :: it would keep the dog house at a warm temputa re , not to hot or not to cold .
28216	10	dark gray ::  Dark grey would keep the doghouse warm er in the cold weather because due to the test results it was warmer than inside the white doghouse. In the summer when it's hot, dark grey wouldn 't be too hot for the dog unlike the color black which would have kept th e doghouse warmer than it needed to be in the summertime.
28217	10	white ::  If the dog house was a dark color, Dark Gray or Black, the it would be very hot in there. If it was Light Gray or Whit e it would be perfect temperture.
28218	10	black :: Using black paint to paint the doghouse would be the best, because it would absorb the most heat, so it would keep the dog the warmest. I know this because in the results from the experiment, in trial 1, the air inside the jar with the black lid had a temperature of 54(DEG)c after 10 minutes. the jar with the dark grey lid had a tempe rature of 48(DEG)c after 10 minutes. The jar with the light gray lid had a temperature of 44(DEG)c after 10 minutes. And the jar with the white lid had a temperature of 42(DEG)c after 10 minutes. So this resulting data proves that black absorbs the most heat, so that should be the color to paint the doghouse so that the dog is warmer. Because if it made the unside of a jar warmer, it will most likely make the inside of a doghouse warmer.
28219	10	white :: this color can not make it so hot in the summ er so the dog can rest inside of it. as shown in the expirement, the whit e color was the least hottest temperature.
28220	10	black :: black would attrack more energy
28221	10	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to co lor the dog house. in the experiment the results showed that white paint has the lowest average temperature at 42(DEG)c theblack had 53(DEG)c th e dark gray had 48(DEG)c and light gray had 45(DEG)c. this proves that white color will have the lowest temperature in the dog house.
28222	10	dark gray :: Black would be the best paint color for the dog house, because it will absorb the most heat, and keep the dog house warm.
28223	10	dark gray :: Dark Grey will keep the doghouse warm in the winter and cooler then black in the summer. The black (as shown in the ta ble) was definitley the warmest with an average tempurature of 53(DEG)C. Dark grey had an average of 48(DEG)C light grey had 45(DEG)C, and whit e was only 42(DEG)C. with a range of 42-53, I believe that dark grey bei ng somewhere in the middle, was a good choice for all seasons.
28224	10	white ::  because it reflects the suns radiation unlike all the others that attract the suns radiation
28225	10	dark gray :: Well for 1. what type of dog is it. 2. depend ing on the type of year it is.
28226	10	dark gray :: Keeps it warmer then light gray or white for the winter but keeps it cooler then Black for the summer
28227	10	dark gray :: They might want to use the dark gray paint be cause when the sun hits it it won't get to hot and when there is not sun it won't get to cold. I disocvered this by looking at the results of the experiment and they show that after ten minutes of the light hitting the dark gray it was about 48(DEG)C and the temp stayed constistant through out the trials.
28228	10	black ::  This color might affect the dog house by maki ng it wormer because the darker the color the wormer the dog house will b e.
28229	10	white :: The color white would effect the dog house be cause the temperature would stay cooler when the sun is out because white doesnt absorb as much energy than darker colors do. That way, the dog wo uldn't over heat. This is prooved in the experiment because the white lid caused the air to have an average temperature of 42(DEG)c which was the coolest temperature. Black, which was the darkest color made the air hav e an average temperature of 53(DEG)c.
28230	10	white :: White would bring the doghouse cooler. This i s shown by the results in the past experiment. With the white colored lid on the jar being the coldest tempature.
28231	10	white ::  it will be cooler in the summer but still war min the winter the average temputere was42 (DEG)c
28232	10	white :: If you were to paint the dog house white it w ould be cool inside in the summer because white reflects heat energy more than light gray, dark gray, and black, black absorbs heat energy.
28233	10	black :: Black would aggect he inside of the doghouse because dark colors absorb heat and black would increase the indoor tempe rature.
28234	10	dark gray :: Dark gray would affect the temperature inside of the doghouse by making it a little warmer but not to hot. In the expe riment to see if the color affected the temperature black was the hotest. White was the coolest. I picked dark gray because it stayed 48(DEG) the whole time and would not be to hot or to cold.
28235	10	dark gray :: i choose dark grey because it will keep the d og house warm in winter. But cool in the summer.
28236	10	white ::  I think that white would be the best color to paint the doghouse. White would be the best because it stays the coolest . In the investigation the lid color that stayed the coldest was the white lid.The average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG) C. W hile the others were 53(DEG)C for black, 48(DEG)C for dark gray, and 45 (DEG)C for light gray. If I were the dog I would want a nice cool house because I wouldn't want to feel all hot and stuffy.
28237	10	white :: Black because the dog house would catch on fi re.
28238	10	black :: it might keep the dog house warm at night
28239	10	white ::  The white paint on a dog house would ensure t hat the dog house would never be to hot for a dog to safely live within it. In this experiment Brandi and Jerry put different colored lids on glass jars filled with air that was,at the start of the expeirement a t 24(DEG)C.THey then heated 4 jars with diffeent colored lids under a ho t lamp to see wich color,black,dark gray, light gray, or white wouldeffec t the air temperature within the jar the most. After three trials on each of the four jars,Brandi and Jerry averaged the Teperatures for each jar after being heated.Black, the hottest color, on average rose 30(DEG)C af ter ten minutes,while White only rose an average of 18(DEG).So if Brandi and Jerry were also building a dog house then they would want to paint i t white beacause the temperatureof the air within would not become danger ous in the summer months when the ambient temperature becomes higher.
28240	10	white :: it wouldnt be to hot for a dog
28241	10	white :: i would paint the dog house white because it would keep the dog cool when its hot, outside i know this because in the data table white was the coldest color
28242	10	white :: The color might affect the doghouse because the average of the white color is 42 and it wiil not keep it warm inside the doghouse. And the others colors temperature average is 45 48.
28243	10	white :: white has an average tempature of 42 which wi ll make it much more cooler in the dog house than any of the other dark colors whos temperature is 45 or higher acorrding to the data table
28244	10	white ::  The color of the dog house should be white be cause it would be cooler inside the dog house ( around 42(DEG)C). If it was a darker color, it would be warmer in the dog house (around 53(DEG) C).
28245	10	dark gray :: it will affect the dog house because dark col ors absosrb heat so if the dog gets cold it would have heat also when it dirty you still can see it so it will be clean
28246	10	dark gray :: i think that the dark gray dog house is the b est color because in the winter it will be warm in sid and in the summer it will be cold outside because its average temperature is sorta in the m iddle (48(DEG)) of all the average temperatures.
28247	10	white ::  White would be the best color because in the expiriment black had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C, dark g ray had an average of 48(DEG) C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG) C, and white had an average of 42(DEG) C. White had a differece of 11(DEG) C from black, making it a better cho ice to keep a dog house cool.
28248	10	white :: white will make the doghouse cooler because w hite had the least average heat
28249	10	white :: because more air can get inside the dog house
28250	10	white ::  You would want a lighter color like white so that not as much heat gets trapped in the doghouse, cooking your dog.
28251	10	dark gray :: i think the dark grey would effect the dog ho use the most because, it would always give the dog shade and it wou ldnt be to bright in the morning or the day that way the dog could sleep when ever it wanted.
28252	10	light gray :: That color would keep the dog house cool but not freezing and not so hot that the dog would be panting either. In the results it said that the high temperature was 53(DEG)C and the low was 4 2(DEG)C. 53(DEG) would be very hot in the summer and 42(DEG) would be very cold in the winter. So 45(DEG) would keep it mostly the same all th rough out the year.
28253	10	dark gray :: i chose dark gray becuase in summer it would not be as hot as black, and in winter it would not be to cold as white or light gray
28254	10	black :: i chose this because it got a higher average than the other houses.
28255	10	black ::  If they use Black it will keep the dog warm i n winter and summer. black absorbs heat so inside the dog house will be w arm,if the dog house color was light gray the avergae temperture would be around 45(DEG)c but thats with a jar and white would be 42(DEG)c and wi th black it be 53(DEG)c so it will be even warmer in a dog house.
28256	10	black :: It will absorb sunlight and heat up the Dogho use
28257	10	white :: White will affect the dog house because light er colors dont attract sunlight that much like black does, so white would make the doghouse stay cooler.
28258	10	white :: whit ewould probably make the air inside the jar cooler than it would be if i was back or any other dark color.
28259	10	white ::  The white pant will not absorb as much heat so inside the doghouse will be cooler. As you can see from the data, black absorrbed the most heat with the average temperature of 53(DEG)C while the white paint made the air in the jar rise to an average of 42(DEG)C.
28260	10	dark gray ::  I think the best color for the dog house would be dark gray because dark gray will not make the air temperature raise as much as the some of the other colors, but it also won't make it too cold for the dog. The average test results for dark gray was 48(DEG)C where the black was at 53(DEG)C which was the highest. The lowest was the white and that was at 42(DEG)C. So, the dark gray is about in the middle of the highest and lowest results so it should be just about perfect temperature for the dog.
28261	10	black :: Black would help keep the doghouse warm becau se after sitting in a jar for ten minutes the black lid had the highest a verage tempeture.
28262	10	black :: Black paint will affect the dog house because when it is hot outside the inside will be extremly hot. In the Data tabl e the average for black paint is 53(DEG)C compared to the average of whi te paint (42(DEG)C). Meaning the darker the color the more heat.
28263	10	white :: If Brandi and Jerry live in a hotter environm ent,then white woulkd be the best choice for comfort because lighter colo rs attract more heat.If it is colder,then they should go with black for t he dog house color because black absorbs more energy.
28264	10	white :: it would make the dog house cooler because wh ite deflects more heat making it cooler and black attracs more heat makin g it hotter
28265	10	white :: i think they should use white for the dog hou se because the darker the color of the lid in the expirament the hotter t he air was in the jar.data for white was 42(DEG)and the data for black w as53(DEG) so its a sugnificant diffrence in the temp so they should use white so the dog wont be as hot in his dog house.
28266	10	white ::  White is a color that reflects all colors so in that case makeing it cooler and blac and dark grey and light grey will atract the sun and other colors.
28267	10	white :: It could effect it by if the color was dark then it would absorb more energy. if it is light is light then it won t absorb alot energy.
28268	10	white ::  White, Because white has the less temperature , So that means the paint will last longer then having black , dark grey , or light grey . if you ended up having that the paint would last as lon g as the white paint.
28269	10	white ::  I choose white because according to the data table white absorbed the least amount of heat compared to the other color ed lids. Also the dog will most likely be hot so you want a color that wo nt make the dog house hot.
28270	10	dark gray ::  Painting the doghouse dark gray affects the d oghouse and the dog living it in. With white paint, the doghouse will hav e a temperature of about 42(DEG)C. With a temperature of 42(DEG)C the d og my get too cold but black paint creates a temperature of about 54(DEG) C, which may cause the dog to get too warm. Dark gray makes a temperature of ab out 48(DEG)C that isn't too warm or too cold.
28271	10	dark gray :: Well the color dark grey would help the dog k eep warm and not cold in the dog house. and it will also be a nice color and the dog will most likley like the dog house if it's not too hot for h im or to cold.
28272	10	light gray :: the light grey would make it not too hot but also not to cold so you can cool down easy but not stay to cold like if t he sun is shining on a black house you arnt going to get very cool in you r house but if its light grey or grey then you have a better chance of st aying cool llike many of the houses in the world that are light gre y
28273	10	black ::  The color black will keep the dogouse at an a verage temperature of 53(DEG) C, which I think this is a good mild tempe rature for a dog. The results also stated that the colors dark gray, ligh t gray, and white would result in a 40(DEG) temperate, which I believe w ould be too cold. I think it may get a bit hotter or colder temperature i nside the doghouse because of the size difference in a jar, but I still b elieve black would be the best color to paint it.
28274	10	white :: less heat would go in to the doghouse if they chose a white background
28275	10	light gray :: the light gray will affect the dog house by c hanging the light gray color to possably to w hite
28276	10	white :: Using white for the doghouse would keep the d oghouse the coolest temperature. The black lid made the air temperature i n the jar 53(DEG)C. The white lid made the air temperature in the jar 48 (DEG)C. The white lid made the air temperature of the jar 5(DEG)C coole r than the black lid.
28277	10	white :: END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28278	10	dark gray ::  Dark gray might affect the dog house because it will keep it warm in the winter and cool in the summer because it had an in between average temperature
28279	10	light gray :: light gray because it wouldnt absorb alot of energy.
28280	10	black :: the color might affect the dog house because it gets hotter.
28281	10	dark gray :: Black might ake the dog house too hot because in the expirament black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. White w ould make the dog house to cold because in the expiranment the average te mperature was 42(DEG)C. I chose dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot or to cold because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG) C.
28282	10	white :: i would choose whitre because white attracts the least amout of heat, so the dog would stay nice and cool.
28283	10	light gray :: When it's sunny outside and the dog is inside his or her's dog house then they will get some nice heat because it is a light gray. If you used white then there wouldn't have been that much he at. And if it was dark gray or black then it would be too hot.
28284	10	black :: Black would affect the doghouse by making it warmer so when its raining the dog can go inside the doghouse to get warmer because black absorbs more light and that can be heat. Like in the experiment black averaged out to be the warmest color and absorbed the most light.
28285	10	white :: The color white will not get as hot as the ot her colors because white, as was shown in the table, was the least hot
28286	10	white :: white would be the best color for the dog hou se because white doesnt absorb as much heat as seen by the comparason of the average temperature so the inside of the dog house wont be as hot
28287	10	black :: Black would make the dog hose the hottest.
28288	10	dark gray ::  If the doghouse was painted dark gray, then t he temperature inside the house would be warm. This is becaue it is a darker tone, meaning it absorbs more heat. If Brandi and Jerry live in a cooler place this might help, but it also works in warmer situations beca use then there is more heat to absorb versus the cooler place where there is less heat.
28289	10	white :: The white does not bing in as much heat as th e other colors.
28290	10	dark gray ::  It will the dog house not the hot and not tha t cold as well so pretty warm doghouse
28291	10	white :: The lightest color (white) will be the least warm color in the dog house. This is supprorted by the expirement data. W hite was the coldest temp (42(DEG)C) while black was the hottest (53(DEG) C)
28292	10	white :: How this color might effect the dog house is that if dog house is painted black it will heat up more because in Brandi and jerry's experiment the black lid had a average of 53(DEG)C. The Dar k Gray Had an average of 48(DEG)C. White is the best because its Average heat was 42(DEG)C.
28293	10	light gray ::  I would choose light gray beacuse it's a happ y medium. i will keep the dog house cool while also keeping it warm. The average was 45 meaning the balck might be to warm and the white might be to cool.
28294	10	black ::  I chose the color black. This color can affect the dog house by in the cold times, being warm. But in the summer it will get hot most likely and that will force the dog out of his little doghouse to get some fresh air. In the experiment, the temperature for the color black were 53(DEG) C on average and that is pretty high compared to the color white's temperature with it being 42(DEG)C average. And there is a big advantage if a black dog house because when when you have a chilly weather you will have the black absorbing sunlight and any energy that is available comparing to white, with absorbing barely anythin g.
28295	10	dark gray :: Although dark gray can be really hot during t he summer, it won't be that hot during the winter. They need to balance i t out. If they pick white, it will be fine for the dog in the summer but the dog would freeze during the winter. If they pick black, the dog would be sweating all the time in the summer but in the winter it won't be sup er freezing like when the white is painted during the winter.
28296	10	white :: It wont get as hot as the other colors. the white had the coldest average temperature at 42.
28297	10	dark gray ::  So in the summer its not to hott but in the w inter its not to cold. Also the dong will not have a heat stroke in the s ummer or freeze in the winter. Also dark gray can hold in heat real ly good. So thats why i thing they should use dark gray for the doghouse color.
28298	10	black :: If you paint it black it will keep the dog ho use warmer than if you had painted it white, light gray, or dark grey
28299	10	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house white so the dog doesn't get too hot when inside. They should do this so that when the sun shines down on the doghouse the inside tempurature doesn't get too hot for the dog. The white lid only got to 42(DEG)C while the black got to 53(DEG) C and the Dark gray got to 48(DEG)C and the light gray got to 45(DEG)C. If you don't want the dog to get too hot, then they should paint the doghouse white. Also because the white lid only heated up 18(DEG)C while the Black heated up 29(DEG)C, the Dark gray 24(DEG)C, and the light gray 21(DEG)C. They should paint the doghouse white so when the sun shines on the roof it doesn't get too hot inside for the dog.
28300	10	black :: From the results of the experiment black woul d be a good paint color for the dog house because, during the cold season but when there is some sun the dog would be kept the warmest. I know thi s because of the results (of black) is 53(DEG)c and dark gray was at 48(DEG) c. So the best color for the dog house would be black.
28301	10	black :: The paint won't be ask thick as the others. Since the black paint had the most average, the black paint was thinest which made it eaiser to paint and didn't smell as bad.
28302	10	black :: By black being the darkest color it will attr act more heat for the doghouse. in Every trial Black was at least 4 degre es higher in temperature.
28303	10	dark gray ::  During the day the dog house would stay in the 40's maybe 50 degrees so the dog wouldent be too hot during the day and at night it would stay warm from all the heat the color caught during the day.
28304	10	white :: If it is really hot in the summertime then th e dog could cool off in the doghouse because according to the experiment, the color white absorbs less heat energy
28305	10	light gray ::  i choose light gray , because it gives the do g house an average temperature of 45(DEG)C , not to hot not to cold ?
28306	10	light gray :: Light gray would be a good color for a dog ho use because it lets a little heat in but not as much as dark grey and bla k.
28307	10	black :: This color might affect the temperature of th e dog house because it will be the warmest for the dog because the sun bl ack color will soak up the warmthness of the sun, and you want the dog to stay warm and not freeze to death.
28308	10	dark gray :: The dark grey would not make the doghouse very hot like the black paint which was at 53(DEG) average, but it would not be as cool as the white paint which was at 42(DEG) average.
28309	10	white ::  The inside of the dog house will be cool, rather than hot
28310	10	black :: The best paint color for a doghouse would be black. The data table shows that it increases air temperature the most, s o with a black doghouse, the dog would always be warm when it's inside of it.
28311	10	white :: I would suggest to color the dog house white because white color doesnt absorb light, it just reflects it and the dog would be more happy because the color is very cold-looking because it doe snt absorb light. According to the data on the experiment the average of the white lid color is 42(DEG), the black color is 53(DEG), the dark gr ay color is 48(DEG) and the light gray color is 45(DEG). so i prefer wh ite color the most
28312	10	white ::  the color white will affect the dog house by cooling the inside down therefore makin-g the house more comfortable for the dog. this is supported by the conclusion of their test because the te st shows that the white lided can's average temperature was 42(DEG)C and the other results were 45, 48, and 54(DEG)C showing that the white was cooler
28313	10	white :: Using white paint for the dog house would be the coolest option for the paint. I think this because, the white paint h ad the lowest temperature in the jar. On average, the temperature inside the jar was only 42(DEG)C with the white paint. It was the lowest temper ature out of the black (53(DEG)C), dark grey (48(DEG)C), and light grey (45(DEG)C). Using the white paint would affect the doghouse by keeping it much cooler then the other colors. So, The best option for the paint w ould be white.
28314	10	black :: the color might affect the inside of doghouse because the darker the color more light or heat energy atttacts. the ins ide of doghouse would be warmer than using a lighter color.
28315	10	black :: if you paint your doghouse black, then it wil l be the warmest. dark colors absorb energy way better than light colors do. in the data table it says that for the color black, the jar temperatu re was 54(DEG),52(DEG),54(DEG),and the average was 53(DEG). while the color white got 42(DEG),43(DEG),41(DEG),and their average temperature was 42(DEG). therefore black would be the best color to keep your dog w arm.
28316	10	black :: i think that black might affect the doghouse becouse the numbers areway higher thanthe other colors higher than the re st of the numbers there all in the fourties except for black i think all of them would work except for black becousethe numbers are higher than th e other colors and i dont think that you would see the color at nig ht that is why i think that wouldn't work on the doghouse
28317	10	white :: this color would make the dog house more cool er then anyother color becuase it is the lightest if you were to make the dog house black it would be really hot becuase heat attratcts to black.
28318	10	white :: it might be to cold in the dog house during t he winter unlike if it was painted black then it would be warm, but white doesnt attrack as much heat so be good for summer.
28319	10	white ::  White would be the best paint color because i t does not get as warm as the other colors. It's average temperature afte r 10 minutes was 42(DEG)C unlike the other colors whose temperature afte r 10 minutes were Black-53(DEG)C, Dark Gray-48(DEG)C and Light Gray-45(DEG) C.
28320	10	dark gray :: cause it is a dark color but not to dark so t here will be air
28321	10	white :: the color white because in the experiment the white cap got the lowest amont of heat so the white will make it less ho t for the dog.
28322	10	white ::  The color white would be best for the dog hou se because it would keep it most cool. I know this because from the experiment the results from black were much warmer temperatures than the light colo rs like white. From the results in the table you can see that black was 1 1degrees warmer than white. So in conclusion if you wanted to keep the do g house cool it would be best to use white.
28323	10	white :: it doesnt absorb heat like black and all the other dark colors.it would stay cooler in the dog house.
28324	10	white ::  White absorbed the least amount of energy in the data, so if white were to be the color of the doghouse, the temperature inside would over all be lower than if the doghouse was painted a different color that would absorb more energy.
28325	10	light gray :: light gray is the best color to paint the dog house because, it wont atract much heat and it wont be cold so its perfec t temperature for a dog, a good temperature is usaley at 45(DEG)c and th e light gray has an average of 45(DEG)c so light gray will be the beast
28326	10	black :: black obsorbed more heat therefore, that will keep the dog warm.
28327	10	black ::  Black would be the best paint color because i t would keep the inside of a dog house warmer then the other colors. This is better because the dog would then be warmer at night then he would be with other colors. The data supports this. Black got an average of 53(DEG) Celcius which was 5(DEG) degrees warmer then the next warmest color, dark gra y.
28328	10	black :: the black paint will hold the heat in when it is cold outside
28329	10	black ::  that color could keep the inside of the dog h ouse more warm because the black asorbs the suns energy. i also p icked black because the data of lids over the jars showed how black affec ted the tempature by making it warmer
28330	10	light gray :: They should make the dog house light grey bec asue it would keep it cool in the summer but warm in the winter
28331	10	light gray :: This color would be best because it would kee p the dog cooled off in the summer, but also keep it warmer in the winter if it was ever outside.
28332	10	black :: Black will affect the doghouse by makin g it hotter because in the experiment the data show that the color black absorbed the most heat.
28333	10	white :: its gonna effect the tempature in the dog hou se
28334	10	black :: The balck color I chose will make the dog hou se warmer for the dig because black absorbs more energy than the ither co lors. Black had an average of 53(DEG)C air temperature inside a glass ja r while a white lid on a glass jar had only 42(DEG)C. thus macking black the better choice bcause it will abosrb more energy making the dog house warmer for the dog.
28335	10	dark gray :: i think dark gray would be a good color because the starting tempeture was 24(DEG) and it's not to hot or to cold
28336	10	white :: white is the color to see at when you looking for the dog.
28337	10	white :: It would make the air inside the dog house co oler, making the dog want to be in it instead of outside.
28338	10	black ::  The color black is a dark color, which absorb s more energy. Meaning that the air temperature would be quite warm and i nsulated. Based on the table, the average temperature inside a glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. While a glass jar with a white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes (Both at a starting temperature of 24(DEG)C). So, the darker the color of the lid on the glass jarthe higher the temperature inside it.
28339	10	dark gray ::  It will keep the dog pretty warm, but not too hot.
28340	10	black ::  The darker the color the more energy is being absorbed. Average temperature on the black was 53(DEG)C which was the h ighest and the average temperature for white 42(DEG)C was lowest
28341	10	white :: The white color, as shown from the data, has an average lower temperature than the other colors. As dogs naturally hav e fur and resent the heat much more than the cold, it is more convenient for Brandi and Jerry, assuming they do not have intentions of torturing t he dog, to paint the house white.
28342	10	black :: wont be to cold or to hot for the dog to be i n
28343	10	black :: black because if the sun is out then it will collect more energy then anyother color cause its darker
28344	10	light gray :: light gray because dark colors are shown to a bsorb more heat causing it to be hotter inside the dog house and light co lors dont absorb as much heat so making the dog house roof light gray sho uld make the dog house, heat wise, better for the dog.
28345	10	light gray ::  I chose light gray because you want your dog to be warm but not hot or cold. The doghouse will absorb energy but not a lot it is enough energy to keep your dog safe from being too hot and too cold.
28346	10	dark gray :: I chose black because the avrage data for black is 53(DEG) and i believe that tempature is enough to keep a dog warm but not extreamly hot where the dog would want to stay outside of it
28347	10	black :: i chose black because black got hotter in ten minutes than all the other colors.also the color black absorbs more heat .
28348	10	light gray ::  The inside of the doghouse won' t be too cold or too hot. As the color is more dark the more hot it will be inside the doghouse.The average for the color black after 10 minutes was 53(DEG) c.The average for the color white after 10 minutes was 42(DEG) c.
28349	10	black :: Black, because instead of reflecting the UV R ays off the dog house, the UV rays are absorbed.
28350	10	white :: white would b e the besdt color for the dogho use becuase it stayed at a constant 42(DEG) when black stayed at a const ant 53(DEG)
28351	10	white :: it would keep the house cooler then the other colors would
28352	10	white :: the color white will keep the doghouse cool for the dog. any of the darker colors wopuld heat up the doghouse and the dog will be miserable.
28353	10	light gray :: I think they should paint the doghouse a ligh t gray so that it can catch a little bit of heat but not to much so that the inside is extremly warm. I think if the choose the light gray the ins ide of the doghouse wont fall apart as fast as it would if they painted i t a darker color such as black.
28354	10	light gray :: the best color to paint the dog house is ligh t gray. If the house is a light fray then the dog house will stay at an a verage of 45 degrees celcius therfore the dog house wont be too warm or t oo cold.
28355	10	dark gray :: The dog house might get to hot if you pant it black but it might get to cold if you pant it white.The average of black 53 and white 42.
28356	10	light gray ::  Light gray would be a good choice because it' s not too cold and not too hot.It would make the inside of the doghouse p erfect temperature. The average for dark gray is 48(DEG)C and light gray is 45(DEG)C. Therefore, light gray would be a better color for the dog house.
28357	10	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the color affect th e inside of the doghouse by the heat the dog wont be as hot or cold in th e the house and he will have the right temperatrue because the temperatur e is 48 and the average is 48.
28358	10	white ::  The color white will be a really nice color because, the avreage of the white lid was the lowest of all 4 colors.
28359	10	white :: i think they should use white because in wint er they could bring the dog inside and plus dogs have fur to keep them wa rm. plus in the summer they cant shave off theyre furr all by them selves so having a white dog house that absorbs less heat will keep the dog coo ler.
28360	10	white :: white might affect the doghouse because it wo nt have that much energy or air for the dog to breath
28361	10	white :: If you were going to build a dog house with a white roof then it would be much cooler then a dog house with a darker c olor roof. If you were going to build a white dog house then you would ne ed to live in a very hot area so the dog dose not freeze. The average tem pature for a black roof was 53(DEG)C. the average tempature for a white dog house is 42(DEG)C. There for there would be a 11(DEG)C tempature ch ange between the two colors.
28362	10	light gray ::  light gray is a good color for the dog house beacuse you don't want the dog house be so dark or a nasty looking color.
28363	10	light gray :: In the summer months it wouldn't get to hot. In the winter months it would be enough to keep the dog warm.
28364	10	white :: White would be the best color to do. I know t his because dark colors or shades absorb heat so you dont want the dog to die from heat.
28365	10	dark gray :: I chose dark gray. It would be a good color b ecause if it's cold outside the dark gray would absorb more of the sun's heat and energy than the light gray and white. If it's was outside it wou ld absorb less heat and energy from the sun than the black would.
28366	10	white :: if they choose this color then the inside of the dog house will be kept cool based on their results.
28367	10	white ::  white will make the inside cooler than if it was black because the darker the color the hotter it will be.
28368	10	light gray :: Because the dog house has hot air in side so i choose light gray.
28369	10	white :: The best color to paint the doghouse would be white because the white doghouse would absorb less light making the dogh ouse color so that the dog would not over heat.
28370	10	light gray :: The color will make the doghouse cooler than black or dark grey would, but it would still be warmer than just plain wh ite. In the diagram, the difference in temperature is shown. With a black roof the doghouse would be 52(DEG)C. Meanwhile, the light grey roof wou ld average at 45(DEG)C, which is probably better for the dog.
28371	10	dark gray :: I think dark gray would be the best color for the doghouse because the darker the color is the greater increase of the air temperature inside the doghouse. The doghouse needs to be warm and c ozy for the dog. I didnt choose black because it would be to warm in the doghouse for him, the dog already has fur to keep him warm si dark gray w ould probably be the best for him.
28372	10	white :: A white doghouse would make the inside cooler . In the experiment, a white cap on a jar made a cooler jar inside than a black cap which made a warmer inside.
28373	10	light gray :: Light gray might affect the instide of the do g house by making it warmmer in cold weather but not to hot in war m weather. Tempatures from the black lid and dark gray would be to hot at a average tempature of 53(DEG) for black and 48 for dark gray. And if t he paint were white it could be to cold at a average tempature of 42(DEG) . Light gray with a average of 45(DEG) would be 8(DEG) cooler than black, 3(DEG) cooler than dark gray and 3(DEG) warmer than white.
28374	10	white :: the color white can effect the dog house beca use in the summer the dog house can give the dog shade to cool down and i n the experiment it shows that white contains the least amount of heat. t he color white only got up to 43(DEG) c, while black got up to 54(DEG)c .
28375	10	white ::  i choosed white because its not a dark color and dark colors attrack heat and bright color doesnt well atleast i think so i hope im right
28376	10	light gray :: i said dark grey it will keep some heat in bu t will not be really hot
28377	10	white :: I would use the white paint for the doghouse, because the lighter the color the cooler the temperature is. In the expe riment the white lid on the jar had the lowest average temperature, of 42 degrees, while the black lid jar had an average of 52 degrees.
28378	10	black ::  it would make the dog house hotter inside bec ause its highest in the experiment was 54 and every other color was 48 to be the closest.
28379	10	dark gray :: dude$
28380	10	white ::  The color white will affect the temperature i n the doghouse because white absorbs least energy because it is a brighte r color. For example, in the experiment the white color had the least ave rage air temperature. The average temperature was 42 degree celcius. The average temperature for the darker colors was greater. For example the co lor black had an average air temperature of 53 degree celius.
28381	10	dark gray :: Dark Gray is the more suitable color because inside the doghouse it would be a constant temperature of 48(DEG)C and m ore comfortable for the dog.
28382	10	white :: I chose the color white because it will maake the doghouse less hot because the color white doesn't absorb as much heat as the other three colors. In the other experiment the first trial black was 54(DEG) C, dark gray was 48(DEG) C, light gray was 44(DEG) C and finally white was 42(DEG) C
28383	10	black ::  the black color will absorb most of the heat
28384	10	white ::  it will keep it cooler because light colors d ont absorb as much energy as dark colors
28385	10	white :: the color white could effect the dog house be cause on a hot day it could get too hot for their dog and could get exhau sted and this way it wont get too hot and maybe increase the chances of t he dog to have more energy.
28386	10	white :: i think white is the best answer to this ques tion. Because, darker colors obsorb heat as much heat as possible, but wh ite doesnt obsorbe as much heat because it isnt as dark as black, dark gr ey, and light grey. This color will keep it cpp; in a doghouse.
28387	10	black :: Darker colors absorb more light. if they use black then in winter it will be a lilttle warmer.
28388	10	dark gray :: the dark gray color would be the best because the doghouse would have to be cool and warm enough fort he dog to be in it. the dark gray color absorbs the right amount of light energy, and kee ps it balanced.
28389	10	white :: It will make so then it is not as hot in the dog house becasue in the experiment the white's temperature was the lowes t out of them all.
28390	10	white ::  In the summer, you would want to paint your d oghouse white, so it doesn't get so hot in there. The color white is an a verage 5(DEG) cooler than the color black.
28391	10	light gray :: I think they should use a Light gray paint, b ecause the inside of the dog house would become a alright temperature for the dog, and it is better than Black or Dark grey because those colors w ould make the inside of the doghouse to hot for a dog. Seeing how the res ults were, the Light grey would be around 45 (DEG)C and any below or abo ve that would have a air temperature thats too hot or cold. If it w as summer, the energy from the sun/heat in the dog house would be cooler, because the color was lighter.
28392	10	black :: The color black might affect the doghouse bec ause it was proven that the color black increases the temperature. So, if you choose the color black it will affect the doghouse by increases the temperature to keep the dog warm.
28393	10	light gray :: this might affext the dog house by keeping th e dog warm in the winter, but not really cold. since they have fur the do g house doesnt need to be warm; on the otherhand in the peak of summer, t he dog would need a chilled pace to get out of the sun. so the light grey would keep the dog warm in winter, and cold in the summer.
28394	10	black :: It affect the doghouse because the darker the color, the more increase in air temeperature.
28395	10	black :: Black would be the best color because acordin g to the graph the darker the color (black was 53 C) the hotter the surfa ce and the lighter the color (white was 42 C) the cooler the tempature.
28396	10	white ::  The white color is not the hottest one, but w hen it is a hot day, you want the doghouse to be cool as possible. If you wanted to get warm, you go outside. Because the change betwe en the starting temperature is less, this may mean that the doghouse abso rbs less of the heat. If it is a cold day, I think that the white d oghouse will stay a more ideal temperature all day than a darker colored doghouse.
28397	10	dark gray :: dark gray would give an average temperature o f 48(DEG)C. This temperature would not be to hot for the dog, nor would it be to cold.
28398	10	white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because it doesn't abosorb as much heat as a black doghouse. In the experiment, the average temperature of the glass with a black lid was 53(DEG)C after ten minutes with a lamp over it. The average temperature of the glass with a white lid was 42(DEG)C after ten minutes with a lamp over it. Since 53(DEG)C is greater then 42(DEG)C the white lid takes in less heat .
28399	10	black :: it will keep the dog warm while its outside
28400	10	white :: This color would affect the dog house by it b eing colder in the dog house then the other colors would make it because from the expiriment it sais that white was a 42(DEG)C.
28401	10	white ::  Painting a doghouse white would keep a dog cool whereas painting the house black would increase the air temperature and cause the dog to be hot, because darker colors absorb more energy. After 10 minutes under the lamp, the white lid's average temperature was 42(DEG)C. In comparison, the black lid's average temperature in 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. Therefore, painting a doghouse white or any light color for that matter winds down to a happy owner and a happy dog a ccording to the results from the experiment.
28402	10	white :: I would chose white because white wont attract that much heat, and it will keep the inside cooler. But if it were black than it would make it all hot.
28403	10	black :: the results of the experiment showed that bla ck was able to absorb the most heat seeing that its average was 53 degree s. while white got an average of 42 degrees. this means that there will b e plenty more heat inside the doghouse than with any other color on any c old day.
28404	10	light gray ::  I think they should have the doghouse painted light gray because in the experiment the air inside at average was 45(DEG)C and white was a little to cold, 42(DEG)C and black would make it to hot, 53(DEG)C . Light gray would be the safest for a dog so it doesnt get to hot nor cold.
28405	10	light gray :: Light gray may effect the dog hpuse in a good way because it day light it will be briqht then at night it will be Dark enough instead of bright white.
28406	10	dark gray ::  The Dark Grey wouldnt be hot like an average of 53(DEG), it would be somewhere in the middle like 48(DEG).
28407	10	white ::  it would make it cooler in direct sunlight
28408	10	black :: black because the darker the dog house, the greater the increase in air temperture inside the dog house
28409	10	white ::  white because light colors dont get as much e nergy from the sun as the dark colors do. And looking back at there exper iment the white paint had the less energy the results where 42(DEG), 43(DEG) , 41(DEG), and lastly was 42(DEG).
28410	10	black ::  it will make the inside of the doghouse hotter by the coler black becuse the sun is atracted by the coloer
28411	10	white :: This color might affect the doghouse because since it has the lowest average of temperature, it would be good for your dog so it does not get to hot in the doghouse. The temperature of the wh ite lid jar is 42(DEG)C, for the light gray it is 45(DEG)C, for the dar k gray it is 48(DEG)C and for the black it is 53(DEG)C. That shows that the white lid jar has the lowest temp and is the best choice for the dog house.
28412	10	black ::  pienso que es
28413	10	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint color because in the experiment it showed that a dark color like black a bsorbs lots of heat from the sun. If you use a dark color it gets to much heat from the sun and then inside the doghouse it would be hot. The dog already has its fur to keep it warm so i dont think the dog would like it to be any hotter.
28414	10	white ::  The white will reflect sunlight leaving the i nside of the doghouse cooler. I know this because when a white lid was us ed in the expirement the jar was 42(DEG)C. Light gray was 45(DEG)C on a verage, dark gray was 48(DEG)C and black was 53(DEG)C.
28415	10	"dark gray :: Dark gray would make the dog house warmer but not as hot as black. Since the air in the jar with the black lid was war mest (at avg. of 53(DEG)C) and dark gray was next warmest (at a avg. of 48(DEG) C), its would keep the dog house in a ""inbetween"" temp rature. Not to hot, not to cold."
28416	10	black :: black well affect the doghouse by keeping it warm. darker colors abosorb more energy.
28417	10	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house beacuse Dogs can easily over heat especially in summer, So the lower you can possibly keep the temperature the better.
28418	10	dark gray ::  if you put dark colors.
28419	10	white :: it would shine and the dog would see its hous e but it can get muddy easly an fast.
28420	10	dark gray ::  dark grey would be the best because the temp was the second highest so when its cold outside the dog house will still get some heat but when its hot out the dog wont die og heat stroke.
28421	10	white ::  Painting the dog house white would affect the temperature inside the dog house because white repells light while black absorbs light. The white lid cover was 11 degrees cooler than the black. Unless they want their dog to die of over heating they should paint the house white.
28422	10	light gray :: I chose this color because it took on less he at than any other lid except for the white lid. It also was warm enough i n ten minuets of time that it would be about 70(DEG)C during miday. The temperature would keep the dog warm in the Winter and cool in the Summer.
28423	10	light gray ::  I chose Light gray, so that the dog house won t be to hot from the black, or the Dark gray. I didn't pick the white so that the dog house wont be to cold for the dog.
28424	10	light gray :: this color might affect the dog house by the tempature.light grey is best choice for the dog house because you dont wa nt the dog to be too hot or too cold in the dog house.darker colors absor b heat better based on the experiment because the darkest color had the h ottest jar which itas tempature was 53(DEG)c and the lightest color had the coldest jar which was 42(DEG)c so i chose the color that is right in between the other darker and lighter colors.
28425	10	dark gray ::  If they give the dog a dark grey dog house th e dog won't die of heat in the summer if you give it a water bowl and in the winter he will be at a comfy heat
28426	10	dark gray :: I chose the color dark grey because 1st of al l, this color was on the upper side of the data meaning it absorbed more energy leaving the space with a higher air temperature. It absorbs energy like black but it doesn't absorb as much. It makes it warm enough for th e winter and cool enough for the summer. The data states the average air temperature for the jar with a dark grey lid was 48(DEG)C which would be fine for an animal considering they have fur.
28427	10	dark gray :: Dark gray will keep the dog warm in the winte r and cool in the summer because it doesnt attract too much heat hbut jus t enough to stay warm.
28428	10	black :: the dark colors absorb more enery.
28429	10	light gray ::  So the doghoouse won't be to bright or too dark.
28430	10	::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house white if they want the dog house to stay cool, because the white lid had the lowest temperatures with an average of 42(DEG)C. If Brandi and Jerry want the dog house to stay warm, they should paint it black because the black lid had the warmest temperatuers with an average of 53(DEG)C. If they want the dog house to be warm and cool they should deside weather they want it to be slightly warmer or slighty cooler. If they want it to be slightly warmer they should paint the dog house dark gray, the dard gray lid it had the second warmest temperatuers with an average of 48(DEG)C. If Brandi and Jerry would like the dog house slightly cooler, they should paint it light gray, the light gray lid had the second coolest temeratuers with an average of 45(DEG) C. It all depends on how warm or cool they want the dog houseto be.
28431	10	light gray ::  The color light gray is the best color for the dog house because black is to warm (average temp.53(DEG)c), darkgray is warm too( average temp.48(DEG)c), white is to cold(average temp. 48(DEG)c), and light gray is not to cold ( average temp.45(DEG)c)and is not to hot for the dog.
28432	10	white :: i think white is the best color becuase in th e dada it say that the tempeture of the jar was 41-43(DEG)C therefore it wont be so hot inside the dog house
28433	10	black :: The best color would be black because since t he dartker colors absorbe more heat then, it will keep the inside warm fo r the dog
28434	10	white ::  it doesnt absorb as much heat. the average te muratue for the white was 42(DEG) c
28435	10	white ::  The color white would make the doghouse coole r (less hot inside) than the others colors. That statement is supported b y their experiment in the following way. The average temperature for all the colors was, Black: 53(DEG), Dark gray: 48(DEG), light gray: 45(DEG) , and white: 42(DEG). That shows that the average temputure for white is lower than any of those other colors
28436	10	dark gray ::  for dark gray to be in the glass jar for 10 m inutes, i picked that color because its the same trial over and over again but also because of the average.
28437	10	dark gray ::  Dark gray would affect the doghouse by making it warm but not to hot inside. I know this because the average temp. aft er 10 min. was 48(DEG)C. Unlike the black whom was at 53(DEG)C with the highest temp., and white at 42(DEG)C with the lowest temp.
28438	10	white ::  This color would keep the doghouse cooler for the dog.
28439	10	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should use the light gray paint for the dog house because in the experiment with the light grays tempiture was in the middle it wasnt to hot and it wasnt to cold it was only between 44(DEG)F and 46(DEG)F so it will be the perfect tempiture insid the doghouse in the summer and in the winter.
28440	10	white :: the dog house will be cooler for the dog in t he summer when the dog is spending time outside.
28441	10	black ::  Depending on the area that you live in, I think that black would be the best color for the dog house. The reason I say this is because that the color black during the experiment absorbed the most heat with an average of 53(DEG) F over the dark grey's average of 48(DEG)F, light grey's 45(DEG)F, and also the white's average of 42(DEG) F. The highest average temperature of the black paint would allow the dog to keep warmer during the cooler seasons of the year such as winter, fall, and even spring in some areas.
28442	10	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse because darker colors trap light so a lighter color will keep the doghouse cooler than if it was a darker color.
28443	10	light gray ::  this clor will keep the dog house warm inside but not to hot.
28444	10	light gray :: It will repel most heat as to keep the doghou se cool in the Summer, but it has a small amount of heat attraction so th at if the dog is outside in the Winter, he can get a little heat.
28445	10	white ::  It will stop heat concentration on the dog ho use and cool the dog house.
28446	10	dark gray ::  The lighter the color the less energy it abso rbs. Dark gray will be warm in the cold but cold in the heat.
28447	10	black :: for the dog house i would use black. i would chose this color because the color would absorb more heat and warm the dog house more. in this expirement black had an average temperatureof 53(DEG) while white had an average temp of 42(DEG)
28448	10	dark gray :: Dark gray is a good color because it's effect towards the heat will keep it a good temperature. It isn't as hot as bla ck which averages out to 53(DEG)C, and it wont be as cold as the w hite, which averaged out to 42(DEG)C.
28449	10	dark gray :: the color will affect the doghouse by getting warm
28450	10	black :: when it is cold and the dog has to sleep outs ide black attracs the sun more and the dog will be warmer
28451	10	white :: The best paint for the dog house woul be whit e, because it will keep the house at a nice temperature because if the ho use temperature would be black then we could predict that the temperature inside the house would be about 53(DEG)c so if the color was whit e then we could predict based on the expiriment that the temperature woul d be about 42(DEG)c.
28452	10	black :: if they painted the dog house black it would make the dog house warmer, then the other colors, because in the experime nt black was the hottest average point.
28453	10	white :: It affects the doghouse because then the dogo use won't absorbe any non-needed temprature in the Summer time.
28454	10	white :: I would choose a white color because it doesn t absorb much heat from the sun. Black absorbs more heat because in the t able it shows that the water in the black lid had a greater amount than t he other colors there were. So white would be the better choice. The dogh ouse would have cooler air.
28455	10	black :: the darker color will absorbe more energy so there will be more heat
28456	10	white ::  in the experement the black and darker color lids were the ones with the hottest tempature so white is the best
28457	10	black :: dark gray
28458	10	white :: I chose white because the darker the color th e hotter the air temperature is. whtie is the lightest color and would th erefore reflect the light instead of absorbing it.
28459	10	white :: Using white for the color of the dog house wo uld keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because in the experiment, the white lid color stayed coolest under the lamp.
28460	10	black :: The darker the color the more light the dog h ouse will get.
28461	10	white :: I think they should pan the doh house white b ecause in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest air t emperature so if you painted the dog house white it would stay cooler in the day so the dog wouldnt over heat
28462	10	white :: this color will make the doghouse be colder t han all of the other colors, the temperature for it was 42(DEG) and the others were higher than that
28463	10	light gray :: It would not get hot enough in the summer to overheat and kill the dog, but it is unlikely in the winter it will die f rom the cold.
28464	10	white :: The doghouse will stay cooler in the summer t ime when it is hot.
28465	10	white ::  out of all the colors that were used in this experiment white had the lowest (DEG)c. the jar with the black lid had 53(DEG)c but the dark gray only had 48(DEG)c as for the light gray, that had 45(DEG)c and finally white had only 42(DEG)c. this data shows that the white doghouse would be the best choice since dogs have fur to keep them warm but in the summer it would be hot they would need a house that could keep them cool but if the person wanted a house for the dog that would keep the dog warm but not to hot and cool but not to cool they would need to pick between the dark gray and the light gray colors since those colors keep around the same temperature.
28466	10	black :: it might make it hot in the doghuase
28467	10	black :: the best color so keep your dog warm and not cold is black it contans more heat and it asorbs a lot of the heat out si de of it
28468	10	black :: black will affect the doghouse beacuse it absords more light and an the heat of the doghouse will incresse because the black jar's avarege tmpeature was 53(DEG)C and the coolest jar(white jar) had an avrage of 42 (DEG)C. the black jar was 11.25(DEG)C h otter then the white.
28469	10	light gray ::  I think they should use light gray paint. The light gray paint would help keep in some ofthe heat but not all of it. I n the experiment, the darkest colored lid (black) kept a temperature of 5 3(DEG) C on average. The lightest color (white) kept an average temperat ure of 42(DEG) C. This shows the darker the color, the higher the temper atures. The lighter the color, the lower the temperatures.
28470	10	white :: I think the best color for a dog house would be white, as it keeps the dog hous at a pleasently cool temperature, prot ecting the dog from excessive heat. The evidence to back up this assumption is sh own in the data table as the white being the color that kept the doghouse the coolest.
28471	10	white :: The inside of the doghouse will be cooler because the heat is going to reflect off the sun. With white the air temp was only 42(DEG) but with black the air temp was 54(DEG)
28472	10	dark gray :: This color may affect the doghouse because it is said that black attracts heat, and white reflects heat; If the doghou se is dark gray, then it might take in heat during the summer while the d og is out playing and then keep the dog warm at night while sleeping, but it could also retract some heat so it won't make the dog too hot, becaus e it's not all the way black.
28473	10	light gray :: If they painted the doghouse light gray it wo uldnt be too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter.
28474	10	light gray ::  The dog house will stay cool but not to cold and not to hot.
28475	10	black ::  the color black would affect the dog house be cause the darker colors will bring more heat to the doghouse so the dog h ouse will be warmer.
28476	10	white :: white might effect the dog house because..it will get dirty easier inside and out
28477	10	white :: This color is bright and reflects the sun's r ays. It had an average of 42(DEG)C while black had 53(DEG)C as an avera ge. This makes the inside of the doghouse cooler.
28478	10	black :: the color black will afect the dog house because the darker the color the more warmer it will be on the inside accrding to the experiment that brandi and jerry did unlike white the color white would make it more cool
28479	10	white :: The best color to paint the doghouse would be white because, the white woulden't make the inside of the dog house as h ot. In trial one of the black lid the temperature of the inside of the ja r was 54(DEG) C. In the first trial of the white lid the temperature of the inside of the jar was 42(DEG) C.
28480	10	white :: It would probably make it cooler inside the d og house when the sun reflects on it...if it were darker it would attract more heated energy and make the dog house warmer inside. So i would pain t it white because it would attract heat but no in the inside.
28481	10	dark gray ::  Well since dark colors attract more heat, the dog would be warm in his or her doggie house. If i would of chosen black , the dog might be to hot, and not really want to come inside it.
28482	10	black :: If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse black then the inside of the dog house would be warmer because after 10 minutes under the lamp the average tempature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C whe n the other colors were in the 40's range.
28483	10	black :: How black might effect the doghouse is it wou ld stay warm inside because any dark colors the sun is attracted to it.
28484	10	light gray :: Well iwould choose light gray because it woul d keep the dog warm if it was cold out. And if it was was hot out the dog would not get to cold and not to hot.
28485	10	white :: how this color will affect the inside of the dog house will be by keeping it cool becasue in the hypothesis it s aid that darker the color greater increase in the air temperature.
28486	10	black :: I chose black for the doghouse because that way the dog will stay warm. I say this because in the experiment the average for the black lid was at 53(DEG) which was the greatest temperature out of the 4 colors.
28487	10	black :: If they painted the doghouse black, then the doghouse would be warmer inside because in the expieriment black was the color that absorbed the most heat because the temperature in the jar was the warmest.
28488	10	dark gray :: dar gray would be the best because its right in the middle, it would be warm in colder whether and cool in hotter whet her making the dog as comfy as possible. hot = cool . cold =warm
28489	10	white :: If the doghouse was painted white, the air te mperature inside the doghouse would be alot cooler than if it were painte d a darker color. In the experiment, the average temperature for the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG). For the light gray it was 45(DEG), for the dark gray it was 48(DEG), and for the black it was 53(DEG). The jar with the white lid had the lowest average temperature.
28490	10	white :: this color would make the dog house the least hot out of the other colors
28491	10	black ::  black absorbes the most heat
28492	10	black ::  They should paint it black ,because the jar w ith the black lid had the highest air temperature. So, if the dog house i s black then the air temperature inside the dog house will be fairly warm . So, in the winter the dog will still be warm, because the dark color at tracts heat.
28493	10	black :: Black will affect the inside because it will make it dark inside of it. If it was white it wouldn't be s dark. If it w as Dark grey it would be dark but not as dark, and if it was light grey i t would be lighter then the black and dark grey.
28494	10	white ::  white because it does not heat up as much. bu t if they lived in a cold reigon then they might want to paint it black because it warms the air temp around it . but they would probaly le t the dog stay in sde for the winter so white would be good. also if it s nows bramdi and jerry wouldn't be able to see the doghouse because it is white. also white becomes less clean over time there for they should pick a color that suit there reigon not if it is warmer or colder . because t hose thing can be controled unlike snow pattens and rain and mud.
28495	10	light gray :: i picked light gray because its a color that would asorb heat and also reflect it. i think this because the temperture s stayed above 43(DEG)c and but also stayed below 48(DEG)c
28496	10	white ::  the color will affect the dog hous by being cooled down for the dog to go when its sunny
28497	10	dark gray :: Dark gray is the best color for the dog house because the tempature isnt too high its 48(DEG) for each trial. And the other colors tempature go up and down for each trial.
28498	10	white :: If you painted the dog house white the tempat ure in the dog house would be less because darker colors attract more hea t. Having white painting would be better for the dog because he will be c ooler in his doghouse but if the dog house was a darker color such as bla ck or dark grey the dog would be a lot warmer. The data shows that the av erage (DEG)C for black paint was 53(DEG), and the average (DEG)C for t he white paint was 42(DEG). The white house was sunnificatly cooler with a difference between the two tempatures of 11(DEG)C which would make th e dog house alot better for the dog.
28499	10	dark gray :: i think they should use dark gray because the dog needs warmth and the dark gray provides 48(DEG) which is pretty war m for a dog
28500	10	dark gray :: i think that the dark gray is the best choice because it stays at a constant degress of 84 degress. the whole time and thats good because the dog will always be at the same temperature.And i dont like the house to be deffrent temperatures so i think that the dog wont either.
28501	10	light gray :: That color, light gray, will not absorb too m uch heat from the sun, keeping the dog house cooler. But it also absorbs minimal heat since it isn't pure white.
28502	10	white :: White will absorb the least amount of heat. I t will be nice and cool inside the doghouse. On average white got the sma llest amount of heat inside the jar at 42(DEG)C.
28503	10	white :: it will keep the house cool.
28504	10	white :: it will make it cooler because its a lighter color.
28505	10	white :: it will make it less hot for the dog since wh ite attracts less heat.
28506	10	black ::  If the doghouse is painted black it will be w armer for the dog because it collects the light. It will be about 10(DEG) warmer for the dog then using the white paint. In Trial 1 the doghouse was 12(DEG) warmer then the white doghouse and 10(DEG) warmer then the light gray doghous e. In the dark gray doghouse it was 48(DEG) which was 6(DEG) cooler the n the black doghouse.
28507	10	white ::  white would be best cause in the summer white wont get the inside of the dog house to be too hot for the dog but black will make the dog house extremly hot
28508	10	white :: Their going to want to use white because it s hows that the white's average was 42 compared to black the darkest colors average was 53.
28509	10	light gray :: Light gray wont allow the dog to over heat wh ile in it but it also wont allow the dog to get too cold. This is because the gray part of light gray osorbs sun while the white part deflects it.
28510	10	light gray ::  It wil make it so the dog house doesnt get oo hot or to cold.
28511	10	black :: teh best color for the dog house is black cou se black got the best average
28512	10	white :: White will keep the light out of the dog hous e, and it is a light color. It will not get the dog house to hot.The whit e will obsorbe less heat from the sun.Black was in the 50(DEG),dark grey was in the high 40(DEG),light grey was in the mid 40(DEG),and whit was in the low 40(DEG) which makes it the coolest color to paint a do g house.
28513	10	dark gray :: I chose Dark gray because the darker the color, the more heat it holds. If you paint the dog house Black, it could hold to much heat in the summer, and if you paint it white, it won't have enough heat in the winter.
28514	10	white :: If you use white then the doghouse will be co oler because the average heat was the lowerst with 42(DEG)
28515	10	light gray :: I think light gray because so that way the dog inside won't be so hot and it will always be warm inside for the dog, The dog won't ever be to hot or to cold.
28516	10	white :: White will allow the doghouse to be cooler th an a black one because it reflects light. Light includes sunlight as well and black absorbs light more so white would work. In the experiment, the black lid caused the a ir temperature to rise to an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid, however, caused the air temperature to rise to an average of 42(DEG)C.
28517	10	light gray ::  The color will affect it because in the winter it will be warm enough for the dog so it won't get sick and it will be cool enough in the summer for the dog in the doghouse.
28518	10	white :: white will effect the dog house by not making it hot for the dog because you dont want your dog to be hot at night. an d i say this because in the scenerio it says that darker colors atract mo re energy and the graph shows that white is less hot than black
28519	10	black :: A black lid will make the inside of the dogho use warmer then any of the other lids. It will be warmer because the dark er the color the warmer the object will get. I know this because I averag ed out the trials and the averages were: -White = 42 -Light Gray = 45 -Dark Gray = 48 -Black = 53 Therefore the black lid was the darkest color and it was the warmest, and the white was the lightest color and it wa t he coolest.
28520	10	black :: the temperature will affect the dog house.
28521	10	light gray ::  I believe that they should paint the doghouse 'ight gray' so that, while the dog house stays cool, it may also be semi -warm; seeing how darker colors soak up more energy from the sun. In the experiment, the black lid was the hottest and the white, the coldest. Due to these results, it is best to go with a more in-between colors, so tha t the temperature may even out.
28522	10	white :: If they painted the dog house white it would cause the lowest internal temperature of the dog house. On average the ja r with the white lid reached 42(DEG)C after 10 minutes while the jar wit h the black lid reached on average 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes. That is a difference of 11 degrees therefore white would be the best choice.
28523	10	black ::  black might effect the doghouse in a way wher e the temperture might be warmer since in the experiment the black color had an adverage of 53(DEG) and white had an adverage of 42(DEG). So if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer.
28524	10	black :: Black will make the doghouse have the most he at inside to keep the dog warm during cold days. When a black lid was pla ced over a glass jar, it averaged the highest air temperature with 53(DEG) C. Dark gray averaged 48(DEG)C, light gray averaged 45(DEG)C, and white avera ged 42(DEG)C. Black has the most heat to keep dogs warm during cold days .
28525	10	white :: i would say the white houise because th e white house is much cooler than the other colors becasue it is'nt to co ld or to hot its the the right tempature.
28526	10	dark gray ::  Dark grey would be best for the dog house bec ause you wouldn't want your dog to be to hot or too cold at night and dar k gray keeps the right temperature. because its average temperature is 48 (DEG)C
28527	10	black :: The color will effect the heat inside the dog house. Black will make it warmer and white will make it cooler. The darke r the doghouse the hotter it will be. If you want a hot doghouse black is the best if you want a cool doghouse white would be a better color choic e.
28528	10	dark gray ::  When it is too hot, the dog can go in the lig hter colored dog-house to have a little cooler temperature. When it is co ld, he can go inside to warm up if there is sun.
28529	10	white :: Because white is the lightest color it will a bsorb the least amount of energy so the air temperature will be teh coole st. For example, the average temp. for the darkest color (black) was 53(DEG) while the average for the lightest color (white) 42(DEG). In conclusion in or der to have the coolest doghouse they need to paint it white.
28530	10	black :: Because at night the dog wouldnt be able to s ee it because it woul be dark out.
28531	10	dark gray :: its dark gray because the darker the lid is t he grater it increases in air temperature in the doghouse,darker color ab sorbs more energy.
28532	10	black :: beacuae black has the most air temp. then any other colors
28533	10	white :: white would affect the doghouse because white reflects all colors so it would colder in the dog house making it more comfortible for the dog.
28534	10	light gray ::  The light gray paint would keep the doghouse at a just right temperature. The black and dark gray paint would be do ho t, their average temperature in the jar being 53(DEG)C and 48(DEG)C. Th e white paint would make the doghouse to cold, it's average temperature i n the jar being 42(DEG)C. So the light gray would make the doghouse the perfect temperature for the dog, it's temperature being a nice 45(DEG)C.
28535	10	dark gray :: The color dark gray would be the best because it effects the dog house by atracting heat to the dog house. How I know this is the tempurature for the glass jar with the dark gray lid were 48, 48,48, and 48 making the dog house about the same tempurature.
28536	10	light gray :: i think light grey. Just because it's basicly in the middle of the tempatures. not too hot, and also, not too cold.
28537	10	white ::  White doesn't attract heat like the color black does
28538	10	black ::  If Brandi &amp; Jerry live in a very cold place, a black doghouse would be a good home for the dog. According to their experiment, the darker colors absorbed more heat than the lighter colors . The black lid made the air in the jar have an average temperature more than 11(DEG)C warmer than the white lid. If they live in a very warm area, they should paint it white, to keep the dog cool.
28539	10	white :: it will affect the dog house because the dark er the color the hotter it gets so the lighter the colr the less hot it i s that is why white is the best color for the dog house.
28540	10	white :: If the dog house is painted white, then incas e it ever gets really hot outside, their dog won't get too hot whil e he's inside it.
28541	10	white :: i chose white because in the graph it says th e average is42 and the others are 53,48,45, so white is the coolist color .
28542	10	black ::  black because it is the warmest c(DEG) color so in the winter your dog will not freeze to death becaus its warmer the n white, dark grey, and light grey.
28543	10	white :: the color white would effect the doghouse by making it cooler inside cause, in the data it showed that the color white had the lowest tempature out of the other 3 colors
28544	10	black ::  black because the sun is attracted to darker colors to make them light
28545	10	white ::  i would paint it white because it wouldent be to hot or cold for the dog it would be just right
28546	10	black ::  White is the best color for the dog house bec ause it would keep the dog house the coldest . The average temperature fo r the white jar was 42(DEG)C, the light gray jar average temperautre was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray jar average was 48(DEG)C, and the black jar a verage was 53(DEG)C. Even though all of the jar's temperatures increased , the white jar stayed the coolest.
28547	10	white ::  wouldnt be as hot for the dog copmpaired to a ny darker colors, i know this from the experiement they did
28548	10	black ::  IT MIGHT AFFECT IT BY CAUSE ITS BLACK AND MAY BE THAT DOG AND THE FAMILY DONT REALLY WANT BLACK FOR THEREDOG HOUSE THAT S MAYBE WHY THAT THEY JUST DONT LIKE OR DISLIKE THAT COLOR!!
28549	10	white ::  You would want to use white because in the expirement a white lid kept the inside of the jar the coolest which means it would be the best for a dog house that way the dog wouldnt get to hot.
28550	10	white :: the dog house might get warm in side on a hot sunny day
28551	10	black :: if thery were to choose black for there dog h ouse color : it will attract more sunlight compared to the other colors shown in there data table. this might affect the comfort zo ne of the dog especially in the summer because the sun will be more attra cted to the color black making it to warm in the dog house.
28552	10	white :: this color will not absorb much heat during t he summer so the dog wont get as thristy.
28553	10	dark gray ::  dark gray would be the best color for the roo f of a doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool in the hotter mont hs and warm in the colder months.The temperature never really changed wit h that color so it will probably be the best for the dog considering it h as its fur coat too.
28554	10	light gray :: The light gray color i chose will not make the house too hot but it will stay warm during the summer and the winter. I know this because on the experiment the jar was only about 45(DEG)c. Which will be perfect for the dog.
28555	10	white ::  If the paint color is white then it will keep the doghouse cooler because from the rusults of the experiment it states that white has the coolest temperature with 42(DEG)c
28556	10	white ::  the wite color would effect the dog house by not attracting that much of light. i say this because in the experment th e wite had less heat attracting to the jar the highestit whent was about 43(DEG)c
28557	10	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should use light gray becaus e teh average tempertature was 45 degrees celsius. A dog has a lot of fur so the temperature shouldn't bee too warm but also not too cold.
28558	10	white ::  With white paint as opposed to gray of black, there will be less heat in the inside of the dog house. (It will be colder.) As Brandi and Jerry saw in the experiment, th e jar with white paint was, on aerage, 11 degrees colder than the jar wit h a black lid. Light gray was three degrees wasmer, and dark grey was six degrees warmer. So it is logical to conclude that a white-roofed doghouse is the best option, especially if they plan to put the dog house in a place that it will get hot. If the doghouse is somewhere VERY cold, however, such as Siberia. Then it would be more beneficial to have a dar ker roof.
28559	10	white ::  usually you will not want the dog to attract heat in the summer so it would be white and in the winter you might want it to be black so it does attract heat
28560	10	black :: you might get a better color because the aver age of black was 53 (DEG)
28561	10	white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler when the sun it shining on it. This will keep the dogs more c omfortable.
28562	10	dark gray ::  The temp. wouldent be too high or too low. Du ring the summer the dog would stay a good temp. I think for me because fo r darkgray the avg. temp. is 48(DEG). It all depends on how hot your dog likes to be how warm the usaly are what time of year avg tamp. at the lo cation for the dog house. How often will the dog be in the dog house. Wha t time(s) of day will the dog be in the dog house and whats the avg. temp atures for the dog house location.
28563	10	white :: it will make the doghouse cooler in the summe r. The darker the color the more the doghouse will absorb heat,therefore white would be the best color.
28564	10	light gray ::  Light gray would affect the inside of the dog house by not allowing it to get to hot for the dog and it offers a nice p lace for the dog to cool down if it is hot outside. Black and dark gray w ould be to hot i think, and white would be to cold for comfort.
28565	10	white ::  might keep it cooler
28566	10	light gray :: It will affect the doghouse by when it is hot out it will stay cooler than a black doghouse because it attracts less h eat energy but if it is colder it will help attract enough heat to be warmer than a white dog house like in the experiment compared to a high temperature of 54(DEG) celcius from black light greys was a 46 (DEG)high. so would be much cooler in hot weather.
28567	10	black ::  If they paint it Black , then the doghouse wo uld become warmer inside, because darker colors attract sunlight.
28568	10	white ::  So the inside stays cool, since white it absorb less energy.
28569	10	black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse beca use it absorbs more energy from the light. The average temperature inside a black doghouse would be 53 degrees Celcius, so the dog would be warm o utdoors.
28570	10	white :: it would keep the inside of the dog house col der than the darker colored ones.
28571	10	black :: Black paint would make the temperature inside the doghouse warmer. In the experiment, the black lid trial average temp erature was 53(DEG)C, the highest of all the other average temperatures. Compared to the other lids, the black paint produced 5(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C, and 11(DEG)C more. Thus, the inside of the doghouse would be warmest if painted black.
28572	10	light gray ::  I chose the Light Grey color because it won't be to hot or to cold, inside the dog house.
28573	10	dark gray :: if its to hot outside its cool inside the dog house. if its cold outside its not so cold inside.
28574	10	white :: the doghouse whould be cooler inside so the dog will want to go in it on a hot day
28575	10	"light gray :: I would choose the light gray because in Bran di and Jerry""s expirement they figured out that darker lids do absor b more heat than lighter lids. So, i would not want to have the doghouse to be to hot, (Black Lid), or to cold, (White Lid). So i just thoght that the good amount of hot and cold was light gray."
28576	10	black ::  I think that they should use black becase if it gets dirty then you wont beable to tell.
28577	10	light gray :: i like football. i like ponies. i like chocol ate. i like racecars. i dont like your stupid test!!
28578	10	white ::  the white pant reflexts the light not exzobs it like black. the white pant will keep the dog cool in the doghouse when it is warm outside. but the only problem is it would get cold durning th e winter when there is little sun.
28579	10	white ::  a white dog house will make the dog house not as worm as black. our high data was 53(DEG)cwhin the lid color was blac k our low data was 42(DEG)c whin the lid color was white the differnce w as 11(DEG)c.
28580	10	white :: If there is white paint on the doghouse then it won't get as hot as if they painted it black. THe lighter the paint th en the cooler inside it will be for the dog.
28581	10	dark gray :: Dark gray can keep the dog house warm in the winter and cool during the summer.
28582	10	dark gray ::  This color, dark gray, might affect the dog h ouse by making it warmer for the animal inside. I chose dark gray instead of white or black, because if the dog house was white, or light gray, th e inside temperature would be colder than if it was black. At the same time, however, the inside temperature might become too hot for the animal i nside, causing it to become uncomfortable. As the data from the experimen t shows, the average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C, while the a verage temperature for the white colored lid was 42(DEG)C. This shows th at darker colors heat up more quickly when exposed to light energy than l ighter colors. I chose the color dark gray, because that way, when the temperature outside is colder, the doghouse will obtain more heat from the sunlight that its exposed to. In turn, the doghouse mi ght act as an insulator. In the summer, however, it will not become as hot inside the doghouse as it would if it was black. This way, by choosin g a color that is neither extremely dark, or extemely light, this doghous e will have a reason for each season.
28583	10	white :: because the diffrent colerd lid did change the temp of the inside of the contanire i would put a white roof on the dog house
28584	10	light gray :: I think the color light gray would be good to paint the dog house. I think this because I know that dogs need a cooler temperature to be comfortable, and it can't be too hot inside. It cannot be too cold either, though. From the experiment, the black lid was clear ly the one that made the jar hottest and white made it less hot. You want something in between, so I chose Light Gray to be on the safe side.
28585	10	white :: white is the lightest color, because it is li ght the temperature in the dog house will decrease, but if you choose a d arker color like black. the color will absorb the heat, and increase the temperature.
28586	10	black ::  If the dog house was black it would absorb mo re heat in the winter and keep the heat locked in.
28587	10	white :: white would work for inside because you can c ontral tempture in inside the dog house
28588	10	"white :: If you wanted to keep the dog house ""coo l"" you would want the roof to be white because white is the color th at dosen't hold in heat compared to black. The black inside the glass was about 53(DEG)C. The dark gray was about 48(DEG)C. The light gray was s till 45(DEG)C but the white was much cooler with about 42(DEG)C. The be st choice would be the coolest temperature which would be white."
28589	10	light gray :: The temperature inside the house wouldnt be s o hot because the color would be light gray which has the second lowest temperature average out of the four. It went up 20-22(DEG) C from its starting temperature, while dark gray and black had higher temperature increase. White had the lowest which would be too cold. The dog has fur so it shoul d be able to be warm enough but also can't get too hot so light gray woul d be the best.
28590	10	white ::  It'll keep the doghouse warm, but the tempera ture won't be so hot that it'll be uncomfortable for the dog.
28591	10	light gray :: this will make it so the dog will not get so warm inside the doghouse.
28592	10	white :: White because it will keep the doghouse an average of 42(DEG) C.
28593	10	white :: It would affect it because the lighter the co lor the less heat it absorbs, so the cooler the dog will be. I know this because in the expierment the color white had the least at 42(DEG)C
28594	10	white :: If they paint the dog house white it will be cooler in the summer because light colors attract less heat.
28595	10	dark gray :: dark gray is the best answer because a dog do esn't want to be to hot or to cold and 48 degrees is a good tempurater fo r a dog house.
28596	10	dark gray :: Dark gray because the dog has fur, and the fu r keeps the dog warm and the Dark gray color is a little cold, and a litt le warm. If the doghouse was black, then the dog would get too hot. If th e doghouse was white, the dog would get too cold. Dark gray is an average temperature.
28597	10	white ::  White will affect the house because it will k eep the dog house cooler because lighter colors dont sbsorb much heat. If the color was black the dog house would be hotter becuase darker colors absorb most heat.
28598	10	dark gray :: It's kinda a dark color so the tempature in t he dog house can increase to 45(DEG)c.
28599	10	light gray :: Why I picked light gray is because when the l ight shines on the doghouse it will have some sun light in the doghouse b ut it will also have a little shade. Another reason is, when its dark out you will actually be able to see the doghouse, unlike when its black you can't see the doghouse at all.
28600	10	white :: White because it would be much cooler in the doghouse because black attracts more heat energy from the air
28601	10	white :: white is the best choice becuse in the lid vs air tempeture we found that when we had a white lid on the jar the jar' s air was the coolest out of thethree other choices this can help b ecuase when it's sunny out side then the dog house will be cooler alowing the dog to be in an a comfortable invorment
28602	10	dark gray ::  In the summer dark grey wouldn't be as cool as white paint, but cooler then black. In the winter it would be a lot war mer than white, though not as warm as black. In the experiment, dark grey 's average air temperature(48(DEG)C) was the average between white's average air temperature(42(DEG)C) and black's air temperature(53(DEG)C). Also, dark grey's results were consistant throughout the trial, staying a t 48(DEG)C. Therefore, the doghouse's temperature would probably be more consistant year round with dark grey paint than with white, black or light grey paint, which were less consitant.
28603	10	light gray :: The light gray color will keep the dog house at a manageable temp. It wont be to hot or to cold. The lighter the color the cooler it will be. The darker the color the hotter it will be. Light gray would be the perfect color.
28604	10	black :: black, because black atracs sun light
28605	10	light gray ::  I think that the best color for the dog house is light grey because it wouldn't get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter.
28606	10	white ::  Painting the dog house white would decrease t he amount of heat absorbed inside the dog house. This is because light co lors reflect sunlight away more than darker colors, like black, and black absorbs light more than lighter colors. The experiment proved that darke r colors absorb more heat and increase the inside temperature of the obje ct.
28607	10	white :: There are many breeds of dogs but some are be tter in colder weather than warmer ones. For these types of dogs, they sh ould have a white doghouse to keep the dog cool in the hot summers. On av erage, the white color was 11 degrees cooler than black color.
28608	10	light gray :: This will make the doghouse cooler in the sum mer than dark gray paint and black paint and it will also keep it w armer in the winter than the white paint.
28609	10	white :: I would paint the doghouse white. The reason i would do this is because it will keep the doghouse cool inside because it doesnt absorb much energy. If you look at the data table, it show that the lighter the color, the cooler it is inside. It also shows that white absorbs less energy than the other colors.
28610	10	light gray :: A darker color asorbes more heat then a light er color. Which is why light gray would be a good choice. In the winter i t could asorb a good amount of heat to keep the dog warm. And in the summ er keep him cool.
28611	10	white ::  The white doghouse would keep the doghouse co lder then the other doghouses. The data table shows that anything black abso rbes more light because the temperature avreage is 53(DEG)C, and the tem perature avreage for white is 42(DEG)C. Also dogs have fur so they dont need to be warm in the winter.
28612	10	white :: It wont get too hot inside. According t o the data table the white lid's temperture was the least compared to all of the other colors.
28613	10	white :: it would give the inside of the dog house a l ighter effect.
28614	10	dark gray :: So thet the house wount be that hot nor cold in the wenter ,or too hot in the summer.
28615	10	light gray :: I think ligh gray would be a good choice beca use if it was hot out te dog wouldn't get to hot and if it was cold out i t wouldn't be to cold.
28616	10	dark gray :: this color will absorb some heat but not alot so it will begood in winter and summer
28617	10	white ::  If you were to paint a dog house i would pain t it white because the data shows that white had the lowest temperature o ut of all of the colors of the jars. So, the dog doesn't get too hot if i t were painted black.
28618	10	black :: black color would be good because it absorbs all the light and keep the doghouse warm
28619	10	light gray :: The color will make it so the dog doesnt have to much heat but a little bit of heat so that the dog doesn't get cold d uring the winter if he is outside
28620	10	black ::  Black had the highest average temperature, ensuring that the dog would stay nice and warm. The average Black tempera ture was 53(DEG), whereas the average White temperature was only 42(DEG) , leaving an 11(DEG) difference.
28621	10	dark gray :: i chose dark gray because it would keep the d og house reasonably warm without getting to warm. i also think it waould be warmer in colder climates and not as hot as black in warmer climates.
28622	10	light gray ::  Because it is not a dark color so it wouldn't be too hot in the doghouse, plus it is not completely light so it wouldn 't get too cold.
28623	10	white ::  in the summer the dog will not be as hot beca use the white point will reflect the sun.
28624	10	light gray ::  i would paint the dog house a light gray beca use its a color that wont attract to much sun so that in the summer the d og has a place to go where he can be cool and feel refreshed.
28625	10	black :: it wont be able to see it en the nighte
28626	10	light gray ::  If I were to build a dog house with the paint color according to Brandi and Jerry's expirament, I would chose the color light gray to use for many reasons. First because it reflects the sun enough to stay cool, but it still has the pigment to absorb the color .
28627	10	light gray :: i chose light grey because it wouldnt get to cold or to hot for the dog.
28628	10	white :: This will keep the doghouse cooler inside to keep the dog from overheating in the summer.
28629	10	light gray :: ::code-98745-16956-666577810-123456789-10::co de
28630	10	white :: The color white will keep the dog house coole r then any other darker colors.
28631	10	white ::  White might affect the temperture in the dogh ouse, becase in the results it shows the color white has the least a mount of heat, so if you wanted to keep your dog more cool, Brandi and Jerry should use the color white.
28632	10	light gray :: The best paint color would be light gray beca use, according to Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the air inside the jar w ould measure to 45(DEG) C after ten minutes. Although the starting temperature may vary, t he average of 45(DEG) C is reasonably warm for a dog as to keep it comfo rtable.
28633	10	light gray :: A light gray color would be perfect for a dog house because the average temperature of air inside the jar was 45(DEG)C . This temperature is in the middle of too hot (53(DEG)C) or too cold(42 (DEG)C). The dog would not get too hot or too cold in the doghouse. 45(DEG) C is a temperature that dogs would love. Therefore, the light gray color would be the best choice to paint the doghouse.
28634	10	light gray :: light gray might have a affect on th doghouse because in the summer it wont attract the sun and it wont heat up as much as a dark doghouse.
28635	10	white :: They should paint the doghouse white because if it is white it is more likely to stay at a cooler tempature. If the do ghouse was painted black it would have the highest temperature of 54(DEG) C while if you paint the dog house white it would have a low temperature of 41(DEG) C. That is why they should paint the doghouse white.
28636	10	white :: This color will affect the inside of the dogh ouse because if it is a black lid, or doghouse it is going to be really h ot inside of the doghouse, because black attrackts the sun, but if you we re to have it be white, it would be a little cooler because the sun isnt as attrackted to white as black. Like they did in the experiment wi th the black lid on the jar, and the temperature was rising faster than i t would with the whit lid.
28637	10	white :: White might affect the inside of the doghouse because when it's hot out and the sun its the doghouse it will be cooler in there thenit will be outside. Darker colors obsorb more heat energy t hen lighter colors.
28638	10	black :: Black is the best color to use to paint the d oghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the o ther colors. In the glass jar experiment, the jar with the black lid was warmest at 53(DEG)C (compared to 48(DEG)C, 45(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C).
28639	10	white :: White will effect the inside of the dog house by making it cooler. In the experiment the with color had the lowest temperature (42) compared to the other colors.
28640	10	black ::  the color black can absorb all the colors and make it hot in their for the dog.
28641	10	white :: so there would be lest heat energy in the dog house
28642	10	"dark gray ::  the dog will want to survive the winter but n ot be ""burning up"" in summer so dark gray can do both of these things"
28643	10	black :: If they paint the Doghouse black it will be w armer inside becuase It shows in the experiment that the darker the color lid the higher the temperature inside the jar was. In the data the average for black was 53(DEG)c and the average for white (a lighter col or was 42(DEG)c. This shows that if they painted the dog house black the dog inside would be warmer.
28644	10	white :: Using white as the colour of the outside of t he doghouse will keep the doghouse cooler than if the colour was black. According to the data chart, the glass jar with a white-coloured lid on stayed cooler than when the glass jar had a black-coloured lid.
28645	10	white :: if the dog house is a different color then it might be hotter or colder. like if the dig house was black then it would hot like in the experiment, blacks average was 53 degrees celcius. white was an average of 42 degrees celcus. darker colors attract more light.
28646	10	light gray :: I chose light gray because on a warm day it w ill deflect some of the heat and on cold days when the sun is up it will keep it a little bit warm.
28647	10	dark gray :: becouse its a dark coler but not to dark for summer so its not too hot.
28648	10	white :: White would make the dog house warm but not t oo warm so that the dog over heated, and not too cold that it would freez e. If you used black, within 10 minutes on a hot summer day, the doghouse would reach 54(DEG)C, in which the dog would probably get way too hot. White would be better for the dog, since it had the lowest ending tempera ture. If you used white, it would only get to about 42(DEG)C, which is a reasonable temperature for a dog.
28649	10	white :: color of white will help the dog stay cool on a hot sunny day
28650	10	dark gray :: It would not really affect the color right aw ay it would take awhile for it to change.
28651	10	black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog house will be warmer because black attracts heat. The data proves that with temperatures at 54, 52, 54, and 53. All the other colors are in the 40's. So choosing black will help the dog stay warm.
28652	10	white :: White will absorb the least amount of heat in to the doghouse.
28653	10	black ::  %
28654	10	white :: It would not absorb as much energy if it was white so it would be cooler inside a white doghouse rather than a black d oghouse. For example, the average temperature inside the black doghouse w as 53(DEG)C which is really hot, while the average temperature inside th e white doghouse was only 42(DEG)C which would be better for a dog.
28655	10	light gray :: a light gray color is good because by looking at the trials that color was in the midde so not to hot not to cold. the dog is not going to be hot on a sunny da y it will be just right.
28656	10	dark gray :: the dark gray color could affect the doghouse by keeping the temperature inside of the doghouse the same throughout it s use. in the experiment the dark gray lid kept the temperature the same throughout each of the trials.
28657	10	white :: It would effect the dog house by making it co oler than the other colors would because in the experiment the jar with a white lid (lighter color) had an average of 42(DEG)C while the darkest colored lid (black) had an average of 53(DEG)C.
28658	10	light gray :: i chose light grey because the color dosnt get as hot yet not to cold.
28659	10	dark gray :: The dark gray roof will keep the doghouse the same temperature. For when Brandi and Jerry used a dark gray lid the hig h data for it was 48(DEG)c and the low was 48(DEG)c.
28660	10	white :: By painting the doghouse white the doghouses air temperature will be lower. The jar with a white lids temperature was 42(DEG)C and the jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. The white jars air temperature was 11(DEG)C cooler than the black jar.
28661	10	white :: It will make it cooler in the summer.
28662	10	dark gray :: i chose dark gray becuase that way it will keep the dog warm in the winter but not too hot in the summer, it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C, the darker the color the more ene rgy taken in
28663	10	light gray :: i choose this color because if the dog house was a dark color it would absorb more heat and if the dog house was to li ght it would be to cold so if you do a medium color it wouldn't be to hot or to cold it would be just right
28664	10	white ::  white because white can defence from the sun
28665	10	light gray ::  if u use black then it will get real hot in t he sun so your better off using light gray
28666	10	black :: Black would affect the dog house by being vey hot inside all the time, and the dog might not like that.
28667	10	black :: If the doghouse is painted black I think that the doghouse will get the more heat (DEG)C because the average of the c olor black for 10min in a glass jar was 53(DEG)C.
28668	10	light gray :: Light gray might effect the dog house because in the spring and summer it wont get to hot and in the winter it wont ge t to cold.
28669	10	black :: I would use the color black for the paint col or for the dog house because it will keep the dog warmer. The average tem perature was 53(DEG) in the jar thats 5 more degrees than dark gray, 8 m ore degrees than light gray, and 11 more degrees than the paint color whi te.
28670	10	black :: This might affect the dog house because it wi ll keep the dog house warm and the dog will be warm. Because the tempertu re for the black was 53(DEG)F.
28671	10	light gray :: I chose light gray because you dont want your dog to be to hot or to cold
28672	10	white :: The white wont absorb as much light as the bl ack keeping it cooler for the dog.
28673	10	white :: the color white will make cooler inside of th e dog house because White had the lowest temperatures such as 42(DEG)c a nd 41(DEG)c. when the color black had temperatures of 54(DEG)c and 52(DEG) c
28674	10	white :: the reason i picked this color is it do es not opsove as much heat.and the dog is ually in their to keep a way fr om the hot sun or the to goto bed but with the color whiteit can do both of these thing and still stay col
28675	10	black :: I think the color black would make the dog ho use hotter because black attracts more heat to anything that its on and t hat why i think black would be a horrible choice for a color. Also in the table that brandi and jerry produced the color black has the the highest g percentage (%) of of heat and the average heat of black was 53.25(DEG).
28676	10	dark gray :: So i said Dark gray because Black will be too hot in the summer time because darker colors absorb more heat. The Dark gray seems like a good choice because this color will not be too hot on a hot day.
28677	10	dark gray ::  The darker the lid color, the greater the inc rease in air temperature in the glass jar, so I chose the color Dark Gray . This color might affect the inside of the doghouse by increasing the ai r temperature into a cooler-hotter area for the dog to stay in, but the t emperature would be about 48(DEG) C, which is a good air temperature of a doghouse, and (it ranges in the middle of 45(DEG) to 53(DEG) because Black with the average of 53(DEG) C would be too cold for the dog to sta y in.
28678	10	white ::  I would say white paint would be best for the dog house because its the color that least absorbs energy. If you want t o save money, i would suggest white because its saving your money and energy. They mentioned that darker the color, the more energy absorbs. The dog house would be not that warm if it was white. There woul d be more light if it was black, but less light if it was white.
28679	10	"black :: Black will change the color beacuse if its su nny outside it would be barker and hotter cause the sun attracts more the n the other colors. As seen on the results. The avrage was about ""53 (DEG)""."
28680	10	black :: it will absorb the heat for your dog
28681	10	white ::  The white color will cause the inside of the dog house to be cooler than the other colors. As seen in the experiment, it would be, on average, 3(DEG) cooler than a light gray one, 6(DEG) cooler than a dark gray one, and 11(DEG) cooler than a black one. White would cause the least heat inside the doghouse out of all the available colors.
28682	10	white :: if you pick a dark color it will absorbs more light and white reflects the light .
