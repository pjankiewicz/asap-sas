mRNA exits nucleus via nuclear pore
mRNA travels through the cytoplasm to the ribosome or enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum
mRNA bases are read in triplets called codons by rRNA
tRNA carrying the complementary U=A C+G anticodon recognizes the complementary codon of the mRNA
The corresponding amino acids on the other end of the tRNA are bonded to adjacent tRNAâ€™s amino acids
A new corresponding amino acid is added to the tRNA
Amino acids are linked together to make a protein beginning with a START codon in the P site initiation
Amino acids continue to be linked until a STOP codon is read on the mRNA in the A site elongation and termination
