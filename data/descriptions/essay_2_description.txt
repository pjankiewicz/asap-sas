A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability

Procedure
Take a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length
Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it is hanging freely down the side of the table
Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample
Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes
Remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types
Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples
Perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1)

The student recorded the following data from the investigation

Plastic Type	Amount Stretched
 (mm)
	T1	T2
A	10	12
B	22	23
C	14	13
D	20	20

Draw a conclusion based on the studentâ€™s data.
Describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results
