1. Installation.
   - Python 2.6.6+ Libraries needed: numpy, nltk*, pyaspell
   - R 2.14.1+ Libraries needed (as in config.r file)
   - RStudio 0.95.262+

* for nltk there is a necessity to download some external data: 
  nltk.corpus.stopwords
  nltk.corpus.brown
  nltk.corpus.wordnet

  It is done very quickly using a command nltk.download() and selecting those 3 libraries
  
2. Place the private leaderboard data set as private_leaderboard.tsv file in data/raw/ folder
   The file that resides there is only a dummy file that helped us create a process.

3. Change the header to setwd(YOUR_CURRENT_PATH) in files: 
   - 1c_prepare_features.r
   - 2_prepare_data.r
   - 4_make_models.r
   - 5_blend.r

4. Run the files:
   - 1a_prepare_essays.py (python)
   - 1b_prepare_ngrams.py (python)
   - 1c_prepare_features.r (Rstudio)
   - 1d_prepare_chunks.py (python)
   - 1d_prepare_essay_specific_features.py (python)
   - 1g_prepare_features.py (python)
   - 2_prepare_data.r (Rstudio)
   - 3_make_models.r (Rstudio)
   - 4_blend.r (Rstudio)

  It will take 1-2 weeks to calculate all the models depending on how many cores you have.

5. The submission should be placed in submissions/private.csv
